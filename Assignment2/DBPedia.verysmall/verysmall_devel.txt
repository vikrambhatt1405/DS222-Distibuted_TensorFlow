The album peaked at number fifteen on the UK Albums Chart. It was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 12 February 1982 for shipments in excess of 60,000 copies.The album deals with the themes of the rise of computers within society. Critics see this album as a peak in the career of Kraftwerk, along with The Man-Machine and Trans-Europe Express. The compositions are credited to Ralf H\u00FCtter, Florian Schneider, and Karl Bartos. In keeping with the album's concept, Kraftwerk showcased their music on an ambitious world tour and issued several different versions of the single \"Pocket Calculator\" in different languages: namely, German (\"Taschenrechner\"), French (\"Mini Calculateur\") and Japanese (\"Dentaku\", or \u96FB\u5353). A fifth version, in Italian (\"Mini Calcolatore\"), was lip-synched to on Italian television in 1981.As was the case with the two previous albums, Computer World was released in both German- and English-language editions. The title of the final track, \"It's More Fun to Compute\", is in English in all releases, as it is based on the slogan \"It's more fun to compete!\" that could be seen on old pinball machines. There are also some minor differences in the album mixes used on the English- and German-language releases.Computer World was listed by Pitchfork Media as the forty-fourth best album of the 1980s. Slant Magazine placed the album at number twenty-five on its list of \"The 100 Best Albums of the 1980s\". Rolling Stone named it the tenth greatest EDM album of all time in 2012."@en .

They have either been ejected from the planetary system in which they formed or never been gravitationally bound to any star or brown dwarf.Some planetary-mass objects are thought to have formed in a similar way to stars, and the IAU has proposed that those objects be called sub-brown dwarfs (an example of this is Cha 110913-773444, which may be an ejected rogue planet or may have formed on its own and be a sub-brown dwarf). The closest free-floating planetary mass object to Earth yet discovered, WISE 0855\u22120714, is around 7 light years away.Recent observations of a very young free-floating planetary mass object with the Herschel Space Observatory and the Very Large Telescope demonstrate that the processes that characterize the canonical star-like mode of formation apply to isolated objects down to a few Jupiter masses. Herschel far-infrared observations show that the young free-floating planetary mass object OTS 44 is surrounded by a disk with a mass of at least 10 Earth masses and can, therefore, eventually form a mini-planetary system. Spectroscopic observations of OTS 44 with the SINFONI spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope reveal that the disk is actively accreting matter similar as young stars. \"In December 2013 a candidate exomoon of a free-floating planet was announced."@en .

Articles_containing_video_clips 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tie-dye> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Tie-dye is a modern term invented in the mid-1960s in the United States for a set of ancient resist-dyeing techniques, and for the products of these processes. The process of tie-dye typically consists of folding, twisting, pleating, or crumpling fabric or a garment and binding with string or rubber bands, followed by application of dye(s). The manipulations of the fabric prior to application of dye are called resists, as they partially or completely prevent the applied dye from coloring the fabric. More sophisticated tie-dyes involve additional steps, including an initial application of dye prior to the resist, multiple sequential dye and resist steps, and the use of other types of resists (stitching, stencils) and discharge.Unlike regular resist-dyeing techniques, tie-dye is characterized by the use of bright, saturated primary colors and bold patterns. These patterns, including the spiral, mandala, and peace sign, and the use of multiple bold colors, have become cliched since the peak popularity of tie-dye in the 1960s and 1970s. The vast majority of currently produced tie-dyes use these designs, and many are mass-produced for wholesale distribution. However, a new interest in more 'sophisticated' tie-dye is emerging in the fashion industry, characterized by simple motifs, monochromatic color schemes, and a focus on fashionable garments and fabrics other than cotton.  A few artists continue to pursue tie-dye as an art form rather than a commodity."@en .

Madonna worked with Stephen Bray, Patrick Leonard, and fellow icon Prince on the album while co-writing and co-producing all the songs. As Madonna's most introspective release at the time, Like a Prayer has been described as a confessional record. She described the album as a collection of songs \"about my mother, my father, and bonds with my family.\" The album was dedicated to her mother, who died when Madonna was young.The album uses live instrumentation and incorporates elements of dance, funk, gospel, and soul into a more general pop style. Madonna drew from her Catholic upbringing, as seen in the album's title track and lead single \"Like a Prayer\". The lyrics deal with themes from Madonna's childhood and adolescence, such as the death of her mother in \"Promise to Try\", the importance of family in \"Keep It Together\", and her relationship with her father in \"Oh Father\". Madonna also preaches female empowerment in \"Express Yourself\". Like a Prayer received critical acclaim, with Rolling Stone hailing it as \"...as close to art as pop music gets.\"Commercially, Like a Prayer became an international success like its predecessors, reaching the top of the charts in multiple territories. The album was certified quadruple platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America. Six singles were released from the album: \"Like a Prayer\", \"Express Yourself\", \"Cherish\", \"Oh Father\", \"Dear Jessie\", and \"Keep It Together\". \"Like a Prayer\" became Madonna's seventh number-one on the Billboard Hot 100, while \"Express Yourself\" and \"Cherish\" peaked at number-two and \"Keep It Together\" became a top 10 hit. Worldwide, the album has sold over 15 million copies.With the singles' accompanying music videos, Madonna furthered her creativity and became known as a leading figure in the format. The music video for \"Like a Prayer\" was a lightning rod for religious controversy, using Catholic iconography such as stigmata and burning crosses, and a dream about making love to a saint, leading the Vatican to condemn the video and causing Pepsi to cancel Madonna's sponsorship contract. \"Express Yourself\" was the most expensive music video made up to that date. The album preceded Madonna's ground-breaking Blond Ambition World Tour.

Frank Baum. The film stars Judy Garland; Terry the dog, billed as Toto; Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr, Frank Morgan, Billie Burke, Margaret Hamilton, with Charley Grapewin and Clara Blandick, and the Singer Midgets as the Munchkins, with Pat Walshe as leader of the flying monkeys. Notable for its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score and unusual characters, over the years it has become one of the best-known films and part of American popular culture. It also featured in cinema what may be for the time the most elaborate use of character make-ups and special effects. It was not a box office success on its initial release, earning only $3,017,000 on a $2,777,000 budget, despite receiving largely positive reviews. The film was MGM's most expensive production at that time, and did not recoup much of the studio's investment until subsequent re-releases. It was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture but lost to Gone with the Wind. It did win in two other categories including Best Original Song for \"Over the Rainbow.\" The song was ranked first in two lists: the AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs and the Recording Industry Association of America's \"365 Songs of the Century\".The 1956 television broadcast of the film re-introduced the film to the public that eventually made it an annual tradition and one of the most known films in cinema history. The film was named the most-viewed motion picture on television syndication by the Library of Congress who also included the film in its National Film Registry in its inaugural year in 1989. Designation on the registry calls for efforts to preserve it for being \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\". It is often ranked on best-movie lists in critics' and public polls. It is the source of many quotes referenced in modern popular culture. It was directed primarily by Victor Fleming (who left production to take over direction on the troubled Gone With the Wind production). Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf received credit for the screenplay, but there were uncredited contributions by others. The songs were by Edgar \"Yip\" Harburg (lyrics) and Harold Arlen (music). The incidental music, based largely on the songs, was composed by Herbert Stothart, with interspersed renderings from classical composers."@en .

The National Interest first published this work in an article entitled, \"The World Trade Center Bombing: Who is Ramzi Yousef?  And Why it Matters.\"    In her book Study of Revenge (2000), Mylroie laid out in full her argument that the Iraqi regime under Saddam Hussein had sponsored the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and subsequent terrorist attacks. She claimed those attacks were part of an ongoing war that Saddam waged against America following the cease-fire to the 1991 Gulf War.  Less than a year after her book was published, the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred.  Study of Revenge implied that Saddam was responsible, and she adopted that view, defending it on many occasions, including before the 9/11 Commission.Mylroie's writings are considered to have been influential among neoconservatives during the buildup to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Several of them praised Study of Revenge, including ex-CIA Director James Woolsey, who called it \"brilliant and brave\" in his blurb for the dust jacket of the book.Mylroie has been criticized by numerous terrorism experts, including Peter Bergen, Daniel Benjamin, and Dr. Robert S.

Articles_containing_video_clips 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Excitatory_synapse> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "An excitatory synapse is a synapse in which an action potential in a presynaptic neuron increases the probability of an action potential occurring in a postsynaptic cell.  Neurons form networks through which nerve impulses travel, each neuron often making numerous connections with other cells.  These electrical signals may be excitatory or inhibitory, and, if the total of excitatory influences exceeds that of the inhibitory influences, the neuron will generate a new action potential at its axon hillock, thus transmitting the information to yet another cell.This phenomenon is known as an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP).  It may occur via direct contact between cells (i.e., via gap junctions), as in an electrical synapse, but most commonly occurs via the vesicular release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic axon terminal into the synaptic cleft, as in a chemical synapse.The excitatory neurotransmitters, the most common of which is glutamate, then migrate via diffusion to the dendritic spine of the postsynaptic neuron and bind a specific transmembrane receptor protein that triggers the depolarization of that cell.   Depolarization, a deviation from a neuron\u2019s resting membrane potential towards its threshold potential, increases the likelihood of an action potential and normally occurs with the influx of positively charged sodium (Na+) ions into the postsynaptic cell through ion channels activated by neurotransmitter binding."@en .

Administratively, it is a centre of Donetsk Oblast, while historically, it is the unofficial capital and largest city of the larger economic and cultural Donets Basin (Donbas) region. The city of Donetsk is adjacent to another major city of Makiivka and along with other surrounding cities forms a major urban sprawl and conurbation in the region. Donetsk is a major economic, industrial and scientific centre of Ukraine with a high concentration of companies and a skilled workforce.The city was first mentioned in 1779 as Oleksandrivka, by the Ukrainian cossacks after ruining of the Zaporizka Sich by the Russian Emperatrice Katherine II in 1775. In 1869 Welsh businessman, John Hughes constructed a steel plant and several coal mines in the region; the town was thus named Yuzivka (\u042E\u0437\u0456\u0432\u043A\u0430) in recognition of his role in its founding (\"Yuz\" being a Russian or Ukrainian approximation of Hughes). During Soviet times, the city's steel industry was expanded. In 1924 it was renamed Stalin\u0435 (\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043B\u0456\u043D\u0435), and in 1932 the city became the centre of the Donetsk region.

After working for the local gas company for a short time he went in 1886 to Germany to work under William Henry Perkin, Jr. in the laboratories of Adolf von Baeyer at Munich University.Back in England, he took a position as demonstrator for Perkin, who had been appointed professor at Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh. In 1890, Kipping was appointed chief demonstrator in chemistry for the City and Guilds of London Institute, where he worked for the chemist Henry Edward Armstrong. In 1897 he moved to University College, Nottingham as professor of the chemistry department, and became the first newly endowed Sir Jesse Boot professor of chemistry at the university in 1928. He remained there until his retirement in 1936.Kipping undertook much of the pioneering work into the development of silicon polymers (silicones) at  Nottingham. He pioneered the study of the organic compounds of silicon (organosilicon) and coined the term silicone.   His research formed the basis for the worldwide development of the synthetic rubber and silicone-based lubricant industries.  He also co-wrote, with Perkin, a standard textbook in organic chemistry (Organic Chemistry, Perkin and Kipping, 1899).He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June, 1897.

(e.g. a fireman, a doctor, etc.) Patrick Bauchau and Andrea Parker co-starred as Sydney, Jarod's childhood teacher and mentor, and Miss Parker, a childhood friend. They are both  operatives for a mysterious organization called \"The Centre\", which took Jarod from his parents as a child and developed his special talents with the intention of making him one of their agents, while also using his brilliant intellect for their own evil purposes. After escaping from their custody, Jarod begins traveling the country, searching for clues to his true identity while posing as a doctor, police officer, attorney, or some other character who helps those in trouble. The Centre's directors are determined to return Jarod to The Centre to further their mysterious plan. A team of operatives, led by Miss Parker, attempts to find and capture The Pretender.

Best known for his supporting and character roles \u2013 typically lowlifes, bullies, and misfits \u2013 Hoffman was a regular presence in films from the early 1990s until his death at age 46.Drawn to theater as a teenager, Hoffman studied acting at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. He began his screen career in a 1991 episode of Law & Order and started to appear in films in 1992. He gained recognition for his supporting work throughout the decade, notably in Boogie Nights (1997), Happiness (1998), The Big Lebowski (1998), and The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999). He began to occasionally play leading roles, and for his portrayal of the author Truman Capote in Capote (2005), won multiple accolades including the Academy Award for Best Actor. Hoffman's profile continued to grow, and he received three more Oscar nominations for his supporting work as a brutally frank CIA officer in Charlie Wilson's War (2007), a priest accused of pedophilia in Doubt (2008), and the charismatic leader of a Scientology-type movement in The Master (2012).While he mainly worked in independent films, including The Savages (2007) and Synecdoche, New York (2008), Hoffman also appeared in Hollywood blockbusters, such as Twister (1996) and Mission: Impossible III (2006), and one of his final roles was Plutarch Heavensbee in the Hunger Games series (2013\u201315). The feature Jack Goes Boating (2010) marked his debut as a filmmaker. Hoffman was also an accomplished theater actor and director. He joined the off-Broadway LAByrinth Theater Company in 1995, where he directed, produced, and appeared in numerous stage productions. His performances in three Broadway plays \u2013 True West (2000), Long Day's Journey into Night (2003), and Death of a Salesman (2012) \u2013  all led to Tony Award nominations.Hoffman struggled with drug addiction as a young adult, and relapsed in 2013 after many years of sobriety. In February 2014, he died of combined drug intoxication \u2013 an unexpected event that was widely lamented by the film and theater communities. Remembered for his fearlessness in playing reprehensible characters, and for bringing depth and humanity to such roles, Hoffman was described in his New York Times obituary as \"perhaps the most ambitious and widely admired American actor of his generation\"."@en .

It is used to cover or decorate baked goods, such as cakes or cookies. Elizabeth Raffald documented the first recipe for icing in 1769 in the Experienced English Housekeeper, according to the Food Timeline. However, it was not until 1915 that Mrs. Fred W. Gurney created the first buttercream recipe, and Fannie Farmer followed suit with several more recipes in 1918 and 1923.Icing can be formed into shapes such as flowers and leaves using a pastry bag. Such decorations are commonplace on birthday and wedding cakes. Chef's color dye (food coloring) is commonly added to icing mixtures to achieve the desired color. Sprinkles, coloring mist, edible ink designs, or other decorations are often used on top of icing.The simplest icing is a glac\u00E9 icing, containing powdered sugar and water. This can be flavored and colored as desired, for example, by using lemon juice in place of the water. More complicated icings can be made by beating fat into powdered sugar (as in buttercream), by melting fat and sugar together, by using egg whites (as in royal icing), and by adding other ingredients such as glycerin (as in fondant). Some icings can be made from combinations of sugar and cream cheese or sour cream, or by using ground almonds (as in marzipan).Icing can be applied with a utensil such as a knife or spatula, or it can be applied by drizzling or dipping (see glaze), or by rolling the icing out and draping it over the cake. The method of application largely depends on the type and texture of icing being used.  Icing may be used between layers in a cake as a filling, or it may be used to completely or partially cover the outside of a cake or other baked product."@en .

They are now available on DVD.The series began in 1991 with Summoned by Shadows, co-produced with the BBC Film Club as a knowing homage to the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who (of which BBV founder Bill Baggs was a fan) and in a pragmatic attempt to take advantage of the consequent pre-existing audience. Summoned by Shadows was a Who-style tale of strange doings on a distant planet featuring three actors known for their roles in Doctor Who and playing similar characters. The unnamed protagonist (listed in the credits as \"The Stranger\") was played by Colin Baker, his assistant Miss Brown by Nicola Bryant, who had played the Doctor's assistant Peri Brown opposite Colin Baker for two years, and the villain of the piece by Michael Wisher, who had been the first actor to play Davros.The second story, More than a Messiah, adapted the Doctor Who Audio Visuals story of the same name, but with the Stranger and Miss Brown substituted for the Doctor and  companion Ria (who was modelled after Peri). In a further connection, it co-starred Sophie Aldred, better known as Ace from Doctor Who, and Peter Miles, who had co-starred (opposite Wisher) in the TV serial Genesis of the Daleks \u2013 both in completely different roles.In Memory Alone, the third film, found the Stranger and Miss Brown stranded without their mysterious transport (never seen or referred to as the TARDIS) in a desolate train station with amnesia, and battling a robot and a mysterious man played by Nicholas Briggs (who also wrote the film along with others in the Stranger series). Most releases of this film (including VHS) include a behind-the-scenes featurette and a blooper reel.While the first three may be (and usually were) taken as Doctor Who by another name, the departure here of the Miss Brown character (for which Nicola Bryant had not used her Peri Brown American accent) and the Stranger himself being likewise \"returned to his proper time and place\" at the story's conclusion allowed for a move to divorce the series from any such notions. The adventures of the Stranger ran in all to six videos (and four audio dramas, although the second audio drama was much the same as the sixth video), in the later half of which the series established its own style and distinct back story, abandoning any pretence of being the further adventures of the Sixth Doctor under another name (or lack thereof).

However, an adult male saltwater crocodile is generally between 4.3 and 5.2 m (14 and 17 ft) in length and weighs 400\u20131,000 kg (880\u20132,200 lb), rarely growing larger. Females are much smaller and often do not surpass 3 m (9.8 ft). As the name implies, this species of crocodile can live in salt water, but usually resides in mangrove swamps, estuaries, deltas, lagoons, and lower stretches of rivers. They have the broadest distribution of any modern crocodile, ranging from the eastern coast of India, throughout most of Southeast Asia, stretching south to northern Australia, and historically ranging as far west as just beyond the eastern coast of Africa and as far east as waters off the coast of Japan.The saltwater crocodile is a formidable and opportunistic hypercarnivorous \"apex\" ambush predator capable of taking almost any animal that enters its territory, including fish, crustaceans, reptiles, birds and mammals, including other predators. Due to their size and distribution, saltwater crocodiles are the most dangerous extant crocodilian to humans."@en .

In 1722 he became a fellow of the Royal Society, and he spent most of his time in astronomical observations at his Oxfordshire seat, Shirburn Castle, which had been bought by his father in 1716; here he built an observatory and a chemical laboratory.He was very prominent in effecting the changeover to the Gregorian calendar, which came into effect in 1752. His action in this matter, however, was somewhat unpopular, as the opinion was fairly general that he had robbed the people of eleven days.  When his son ran for parliament as a Whig in 1754, resentment over his role in the calendar reform was one of many issues raised by the son's Tory opponents; a famous 1755 Hogarth painting influenced by the events of these elections is the main historical source for the \"Give us our eleven days\" slogan.From 1752 until his death, Macclesfield was president of the Royal Society, and he made some observations on the great 1755 Lisbon earthquake.In 1750 Macclesfield was offered the honorary position of vice president of the Foundling Hospital, which he accepted and kept until his death in 1764. The Foundling Hospital was a charitable institution created a decade earlier, dedicated to saving London's abandoned children. The Earl seems to have taken his position seriously, as he commissioned the artist Benjamin Wilson to paint a full size portrait of him, which he then donated to the Hospital. The portrait is still in the Foundling Hospital Collection and available to view at the Foundling Museum.In 1755, Parker was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

He was the second person of mixed race  to play in the top division of the Football League, the first mixed race British outfield player in the top division of English football, and the first to be commissioned as an infantry officer in the British Army. His professional football career began after he was spotted while playing for his local amateur club, Clapton F.C..  He began playing for Clapton in 1908 and within a few months he had won winners' medals in the FA Amateur Cup, London County Amateur Cup and London Senior Cup. In March 1909 the Football Star called him \"the catch of the season\".Tull was brought up in a National Children's Home orphanage in Bethnal Green, London, along with his brother, following the death of their parents. He joined Tottenham in 1909, and transferred to Northampton Town in 1911, where he made 111 first-team appearances.During the First World War, Tull served in the Footballers' Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment, and fought in the Battle of the Somme in 1916.

An example is wind blowing over water: The instability manifests in waves on the water surface. More generally, clouds, the ocean, Saturn's bands, Jupiter's Red Spot, and the sun's corona show this instability.The theory predicts the onset of instability and transition to turbulent flow in fluids of different densities moving at various speeds. Helmholtz studied the dynamics of two fluids of different densities when a small disturbance, such as a wave, was introduced at the boundary connecting the fluids.For some short enough wavelengths, if surface tension is ignored, two fluids in parallel motion with different velocities and densities yield an interface that is unstable for all speeds. Surface tension stabilises the short wavelength instability however, and theory predicts stability until a velocity threshold is reached. The theory with surface tension included broadly predicts the onset of wave formation in the important case of wind over water.In gravity, for a continuously varying distribution of density and velocity (with the lighter layers uppermost, so that the fluid is RT-stable), the dynamics of the KH instability is described by the Taylor\u2013Goldstein equation and its onset is given by a Richardson number, Ri. Typically the layer is unstable for Ri<0.25. These effects are common in cloud layers. The study of this instability is applicable in plasma physics, for example in inertial confinement fusion and the plasma\u2013beryllium interface.Numerically, the KH instability is simulated in a temporal or a spatial approach. In the temporal approach, experimenters consider the flow in a periodic (cyclic) box \"moving\" at mean speed (absolute instability). In the spatial approach, experimenters simulate a lab experiment with natural inlet and outlet conditions (convective instability)."@en .

Released in 1967, the LP was an immediate critical and commercial success, and it is widely regarded as one of the greatest debuts in the history of rock music. The album features Jimi Hendrix's innovative approach to songwriting and electric guitar playing which soon established a new direction in psychedelic and hard rock music.  Coming after three successful European singles, it helped introduce him as a new international star.By mid-1966, Hendrix was struggling to earn a living playing the R&B circuit as a backing guitarist. After being referred to Chas Chandler, who was leaving the Animals and interested in managing and producing artists, Hendrix was signed to a management and production contract with Chandler and ex-Animals manager Michael Jeffery. Chandler brought Hendrix to London and began recruiting members for a band designed to showcase the guitarist's talents, the Jimi Hendrix Experience. In late October, after having been rejected by Decca Records, the Experience signed with Track, a new label formed by the Who's managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp.Are You Experienced and its preceding singles were recorded over a five-month period from late October 1966 through early April 1967. The album was completed in sixteen recording sessions at three London locations, including De Lane Lea Studios, CBS, and Olympic. Released in the UK on May 12, 1967, Are You Experienced spent 33 weeks on the charts, peaking at number two. The album was issued in the US on August 23 by Reprise Records, where it reached number five on the Billboard 200, remaining on the chart for 106 weeks, 27 of those in the Top 40. The US version contained some of Hendrix's best known songs, including the Experience's first three singles, which, though omitted from the British edition of the LP, were top ten hits in the UK: \"Purple Haze\", \"Hey Joe\", and \"The Wind Cries Mary\".In 2005, Rolling Stone ranked Are You Experienced fifteenth on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. They placed four songs from the album on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time: \"Purple Haze\" (17), \"Foxy Lady\" (153), \"Hey Joe\" (201), and \"The Wind Cries Mary\" (379). That same year, the record was one of 50 recordings chosen by the Library of Congress in recognition of its cultural significance to be added to the National Recording Registry. Writer and archivist Rueben Jackson of the Smithsonian Institution wrote: \"it's still a landmark recording because it is of the rock, R&B, blues ... musical tradition.

It has also been introduced to New Zealand, Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Bermuda, Bahamas, Lesser Antilles, and some countries in Europe, such as Finland, the Czech Republic, and Serbia. In the Americas, it is the most widely distributed wild ungulate.In North America, the species is widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains, but elsewhere, it is mostly replaced by the black-tailed or mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). In western North America, it  is found in aspen parklands and deciduous river bottomlands within the central and northern Great Plains, and in mixed deciduous riparian corridors, river valley bottomlands, and lower foothills of the northern Rocky Mountain regions from South Dakota and Wyoming to southeastern British Columbia, including the Montana Valley and Foothill grasslands.The conversion of land adjacent to the northern Rockies into agriculture use and partial clear-cutting of coniferous trees (resulting in widespread deciduous vegetation) has been favorable to the white-tailed deer and has pushed its distribution to as far north as Prince George, British Columbia. Populations of deer around the Great Lakes have also expanded their range northwards, due to conversion of land to agricultural uses favoring more deciduous vegetation, and local caribou and moose populations.  The westernmost population of the species, known as the Columbian white-tailed deer, once was widespread in the mixed forests along the Willamette and Cowlitz River valleys of western Oregon and southwestern Washington, but today its numbers have been considerably reduced, and it is classified as near-threatened."@en .

The film was made by Hammer Film Productions and Seven Arts, and is a remake of the Hollywood film One Million B.C. (1940). It recreates many of the scenes of the earlier film (such as  an allosaurus attacking a tree full of children). Location scenes were filmed on the Canary Islands in the middle of winter, in late 1965. The British release prints of this film were printed in dye transfer Technicolor. The film was released in edited form in the United States in 1967, printed in DeLuxe Color.Like the original film, this remake is largely ahistorical. It portrays dinosaurs and humans living together, whereas, according to the geologic time scale, the last dinosaurs became extinct roughly 65 million years BC, and Homo sapiens (modern humans) did not exist until about 200,000 years BC. Ray Harryhausen, who animated all of the dinosaur attacks using stop motion techniques, stated that he did not make One Million Years B.C. for \"professors\" who in his opinion \"probably don't go to see these kinds of movies anyway\" (this was a comment he made for the DVD of the 1933 version of King Kong)."@en .

He represented William III at various other German courts, and in 1702 was sent to Vienna, where he had already acted as envoy in 1693. In Nov 1697 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society In 1705 Prince Eugene of Savoy requested Stepney's withdrawal on the grounds of his alleged favouritism towards the Hungarian insurgents, but the demand was taken back at the request of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, who had great confidence in Stepney. He was, nevertheless, removed in 1706 to The Hague. In the following year he returned to England in the hope of recovering from a severe illness, but died in Chelsea, London, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.Stepney had a full and accurate knowledge of German affairs, and was a great letter-writer.

Most crawler cranes with an added winch drum on the front can act as a dragline. These units (like other cranes) are designed to be dismantled and transported over the road on flatbed trailers. Draglines used in civil engineering are almost always of this smaller, crane type. These are used for road, port construction, pond and canal dredging, and as pile driving rigs. These types are built by crane manufacturers such as Link-Belt and Hyster.The much larger type which is built on site is commonly used in strip-mining operations to remove overburden above  coal and more recently for tar-sand mining. The largest heavy draglines are among the largest mobile land machines ever built. The smallest and most common of the heavy type weigh around 8,000 tons while the largest built weighed around 13,000 tons.A dragline bucket system consists of a large bucket which is suspended from a boom (a large truss-like structure) with wire ropes. The bucket is manoeuvered by means of a number of ropes and chains. The hoist rope, powered by large diesel or electric motors, supports the bucket and hoist-coupler assembly from the boom. The dragrope is used to draw the bucket assembly horizontally. By skillful manoeuvre of the hoist and the dragropes the bucket is controlled for various operations. A schematic of a large dragline bucket system is shown below."@en .

He cofounded, with directors Harold Clurman and Cheryl Crawford, the Group Theatre in 1931, which was hailed as \"America's first true theatrical collective\". In 1951, he became director of the non-profit Actors Studio, in New York City, considered \"the nation's most prestigious acting school\", and in 1966, was involved in the creation of Actors Studio West in Los Angeles.Although other highly regarded teachers have also taught \"The Method\", it is Strasberg who is considered the \"father of method acting in America,\" according to author Mel Gussow, and from the 1920s until his death in 1982 \"he revolutionized the art of acting by having a profound influence on performance in American theater and movies\". From his base in New York, he trained several generations of theatre and film's most illustrious talents, including Barbra Streisand, Anne Bancroft, Dustin Hoffman, Montgomery Clift, James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, Jane Fonda, Julie Harris, Paul Newman, Ellen Burstyn, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and director Elia Kazan.By 1969, Strasberg had become less involved with the Actors Studio, and with his third wife Anna opened the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute with branches in in New York City and in Hollywood to continue teaching the Stanislavski techniques which he had interpreted and developed for contemporary actors. The Institute's primary stated goal was \"to reach a larger audience of eager and emerging talent\" than was served by the Actors Studio's notoriously selective admission process, ., and as teachers of The Method began to deploy their own personal interpretations of the discipline, \"to dispel growing confusion and misrepresentation of the Method, preserving what had by now become fundamental discoveries in actor training.\"Former student Elia Kazan directed James Dean in East of Eden (1955), for which Kazan and Dean were nominated for Academy Awards. As a student, Dean wrote that Actors Studio was \"the greatest school of the theater [and] the best thing that can happen to an actor\". Playwright Tennessee Williams, writer of A Streetcar Named Desire, said of Strasberg's actors, \"They act from the inside out. They communicate emotions they really feel. They give you a sense of life.\" Directors like Sidney Lumet, a former student, have intentionally used actors skilled in Strasberg's \"Method\".Kazan, in his autobiography, wrote, \"He carried with him the aura of a prophet, a magician, a witch doctor, a psychoanalyst, and a feared father of a Jewish home.... [H]e was the force that held the thirty-odd members of the theatre together, and made them 'permanent.'\"  Today, Ellen Burstyn, Al Pacino, and Harvey Keitel lead this nonprofit studio dedicated to the development of actors, playwrights, and directors.As an actor, Strasberg is probably best known for his supporting role as gangster Hyman Roth alongside his former student Al Pacino in Godfather II (1974), a role he took at Pacino's suggestion, and which earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He also appeared in ...And Justice for All (1979).Strasberg's personal papers, including photos, are archived at the Library of Congress."@en .

The band's lineup at this time included singer Glenn Danzig, guitarist Bobby Steele, bassist Jerry Only, and drummer Arthur Googy. During the sessions Only was grooming his younger brother Doyle to join the band, and Doyle recorded his own guitar tracks and overdubs separately in addition to Steele's.

Five of the songs were released in 1981, with \"London Dungeon\", \"Horror Hotel\", and \"Ghouls Night Out\" being released as 3 Hits from Hell while the \"Halloween\" single included both \"Halloween\" and \"Halloween II\". The band used the remainder of the recordings as demos for their 1982 album Walk Among Us.The Misfits broke up in 1983, but after a series of legal battles in the late 1980s and early 1990s Only and Doyle regained the rights to record and perform as the Misfits, sharing merchandising rights with Danzig, who holds writing credits on all of the Misfits material written between 1977 and 1983. Only and Doyle formed a new incarnation of the band and released two albums during the 1990s.

Warren enlisted Paul Revere and William Dawes on April 18, 1775, to leave Boston and spread the alarm that the British garrison in Boston was setting out to raid the town of Concord and arrest rebel leaders John Hancock and Samuel Adams. Warren participated in the next day's Battles of Lexington and Concord, which are commonly considered to be the opening engagements of the American Revolutionary War.Warren had been commissioned a Major General in the colony's militia shortly before the June 17, 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill.  Rather than exercising his rank, Warren served in the battle as a private soldier, and was killed in combat when British troops stormed the redoubt atop Breed's Hill.  His death, immortalized in John Trumbull's painting, The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker's Hill, June 17, 1775, galvanized the rebel forces.  He has been memorialized in the naming of many towns, counties and other locations in the United States, by statues, and in numerous other ways."@en .

American_film_actresses 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elaine_May> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Elaine May (born April 21, 1932) is an American screenwriter, film director, actress and comedian. She made her initial impact in the 1950s from her improvisational comedy routines with Mike Nichols, performing as Nichols and May. After her duo with Nichols ended, May subsequently developed a career as a screenwriter. She has been nominated twice for an Academy Award, for Heaven Can Wait (1978) and Primary Colors (1998). In 1996, she reunited with Nichols to write the screenplay for The Birdcage, directed by Nichols. She received the National Medal of Arts in 2012 for her unique contributions.After studying acting with theater coach Maria Ouspenskaya in Los Angeles, she moved to Chicago in 1955 and became a founding member of the Compass Players, an improvisational theater group. May began working alongside Nichols, who was also in the group, and together they began writing and performing their own comedy sketches which were enormously popular. In 1957 they both quit the group to form their own stage act, Nichols and May, in New York. Jack Rollins, who produced most of Woody Allen's films, said their act was \"so startling, so new, as fresh as could be. I was stunned by how really good they were.\"They performed nightly to mostly sold-out shows, in addition to making various TV and radio appearances. In their comedy act, they created satirical clich\u00E9s and character types which made fun of the new intellectual, cultural, and social order that was just emerging at the time. In doing so, \"May cracked the stereotype of what roles a woman could play\", wrote Gerald Nachman, \"breaking through the psychological restrictions of playing comedy as a woman.\" Together, they became an inspiration to many younger comedians, including Lily Tomlin and Steve Martin. After four years, at the height of their fame, they decided to discontinue their act and took their careers in different directions: Nichols becoming a leading film director and May becoming primarily a screenwriter and playwright, along with acting and directing. Their relatively brief time together as comedy stars led New York talk show host, Dick Cavett, to call their act \"one of the comic meteors in the sky.\" Nachman noted that \"Nichols and May are perhaps the most ardently missed of all the satirical comedians of their era.\""@en .

The apprentice is cast away on Sucia, an island abandoned by the sect 200 years prior. The island contains groups of the Shapers' creations, who have formed their own ideologies regarding their creators in the intervening years. The primary motivation of the player is to escape the island and, in the process, deal with the forces working to steal the Shaper secrets abandoned on Sucia Isle.The game's setting stemmed from the idea of players being able to create and control a group of obedient creatures. The Shapers and the world of Geneforge were the result of Vogel imagining how would a being possess such power and how would they use it. The game's setting, a mixture of science fiction and fantasy, differs from the pure science fiction setting the game had been envisioned as. Vogel had difficulties balancing gameplay with the powerful directed-energy weapons players would expect to use in a science fiction game. Sales exceeded the developer's expectations, despite fears that the departure from Spiderweb's Avernum series would deter players. Geneforge received a positive reception from reviewers, despite the quality of the graphics being rated as poor and the game containing one piece of music, the title theme.

From 1949 to 1954, Garcia joined Bob Lemon, Early Wynn, and Bob Feller on the Indians' \"Big Four\" pitching staff.

During those six seasons with the \"Big Four\", Garcia compiled a record of 104 wins against 57 losses. He had two 20-win seasons and led the American League (AL) in earned run average (ERA) and shutouts twice each.Garcia's best season came in 1954 when the Indians won a league record 111 games. Baseball historian Stephen Lombardi said that Garcia may have been the best AL pitcher that year. Garcia remained with the Indians until 1959, but never duplicated the success he had achieved in 1954. In his last five seasons with Cleveland, he finished with losing records three times. After leaving the Indians, Garcia spent a season with the Chicago White Sox and a season with the Washington Senators.Garcia retired from baseball in 1961. He developed diabetes within a few years and suffered from kidney disease and heart problems until his death. Garcia died outside of Cleveland at the age of 62 and was buried in his home state of California.

A native of Roxbury, Massachusetts, and the son of one of its founders, Dudley had a leading role in the administration of the Dominion of New England (1686\u20131689), overthrown in the 1689 Boston revolt, and served briefly on the council of the Province of New York.  In New York, he oversaw the trial that convicted Jacob Leisler, the ringleader of Leisler's Rebellion.  He spent eight years  in the 1690s as lieutenant governor of the Isle of Wight, including one year as a Member of Parliament.  In 1702 he was appointed governor of the provinces of Massachusetts Bay and New Hampshire, posts he held until 1715.His rule of Massachusetts was characterized by hostility and tension, with political enemies opposing his attempts to gain a regular salary, and regularly making complaints about his official and private actions.  Most of his tenure was dominated by Queen Anne's War, in which the two provinces were on the front lines with New France and suffered from a series of major and minor French and Indian raids.  He orchestrated an unsuccessful attempt to capture the Acadian capital of Port Royal in 1707, raised provincial militia forces for its successful capture in 1710, and directed an unsuccessful expedition against Quebec in 1711.Dudley's governorship institutionalized a pattern of hostility toward royal governance in Massachusetts, most frequently over the issue of the salaries of crown officials.  The colonial legislature routinely challenged or disputed the prerogatives of the governor.  While this hostility affected most of the governors of Massachusetts up to the American Revolutionary War and the end of British rule, his rule of New Hampshire was comparatively uncontroversial."@en .

His parents sent him to Quaker schools and after graduating from Haverford College in 1927, he and his wife Elizabeth Wilbur, proceeded to find a way of making a living that was in line with their Quaker beliefs. They looked to the American Friends Service Committee, which set up teaching posts for them at a small school in the foothills of the Tennessee\u2019s Great Smoky Mountains. In 1928 Borton and his wife were asked to travel to Tokyo, Japan, to help the Committee's work there.Borton's three years living among the Japanese affected his outlook to the extent that he thereafter devoted himself to studying Japan. Initially, Borton sought guidance from Sir George Sansom, a British scholar who was then serving in the British Consulate. In 1931, Borton returned to America to further his education. He completed a Master's degree in history at Columbia University and studied briefly at Harvard University. He then traveled across the Atlantic to pursue further study under the supervision of Professors J. J. L. Duyvendak and Johannes Rahder at Leiden University in the Netherlands. He was awarded his PhD by Leiden after several years of work at Tokyo Imperial University. He returned to the United States to take a position on the faculty at Columbia, lecturing on modern Japanese history and language. He also played a key role in structuring the first undergraduate program in Japanese studies in the newly expanded Department of Chinese and Japanese. His research publications prior to the Second World War included Peasant Uprisings in Japan of the Tokugawa Period and Japan Since 1931: Its Political and Social Development.Borton\u2019s academic career was interrupted by America\u2019s entry into the Second World War following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, diverting him into public service. Borton cited his Quaker principles in conscientiously objecting to serving in the armed forces, but he was interested in doing what he could to prepare for the peace after the war. In June 1942 he sought leave from Columbia to spend the summer serving on the faculty of the School of Military Government at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville. In the fall he moved to the US State Department. It marked the beginning of six years during which he was in the midst of a corps of officials who focused not on the military advancement of the war, but in preparing peacetime measures not focused on punishing Japan, but on reforming it so that a similar war would be less likely to occur. Borton drafted many of the State Department proposals and was a proponent of many of its positions, including those that resulted in key decisions such as the decision not to prosecute Emperor Hirohito as a  war criminal and the decision to not replace the Japanese government but to disband the Japanese military and replace the wartime leadership. His group also sought to implement fundamental reform of the Japanese constitution.In 1948 Borton returned to academic life at Columbia, where he was a prominent organizer of the East Asian Institute as the University's centre of modern and contemporary East Asian studies. He replaced the inaugural director, Sir George Sansom, and later helped to establish the Association of Asian Studies, serving as its first treasurer and later as its president. Among his works were Japan Under Allied Occupation, 1945-1947 and Japan's Modern Century, which went on to become one of the most widely used history texts of his period.In 1957, Borton resigned his post at Columbia to accept an appointment to Haverford College as its president, before retiring in 1967. In 1972 he retired to his farm in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts to enjoy the farm life which he loved  and to practice his Quaker faith. Borton died on August 6, 1995, at the age of 92 at his home in Conway, Massachusetts."@en .

American_films,English-language_films 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Trouble_with_Harry> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "The Trouble with Harry is a 1955 American black comedy film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The screenplay by John Michael Hayes was based on the 1950 novel by Jack Trevor Story. It starred Edmund Gwenn and John Forsythe; Shirley MacLaine and Jerry Mathers co-starred, both in their first film roles.  The Trouble with Harry was released in the United States on October 3, 1955, then re-released in 1984 once the distribution rights had been acquired by Universal Pictures.The action in The Trouble with Harry takes place during a sun-filled autumn in the Vermont countryside. The fall foliage and the beautiful scenery around the village, as well as Bernard Herrmann's light-filled score, all set an idyllic tone. The story is about how the residents of a small Vermont village react when the dead body of a man named Harry is found on a hillside. The film is, however, not really a murder mystery; it is essentially a romantic comedy with thriller overtones, in which the corpse serves as a Macguffin. Four village residents end up working together to solve the problem of what to do with Harry. In the process the younger two (an artist and a very young, twice-widowed woman) fall in love and become a couple, soon to be married. The older two residents (a captain and a spinster) also fall in love."@en .

Within its widespread range across the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia and East Asia, there are considerable variations and some authorities prefer to treat several of its subspecies as completely separate species. In the past, several species including the Philippine serpent eagle (S. holospila), Andaman serpent eagle (S. elgini) and South Nicobar serpent eagle (S. klossi) were treated as subspecies of the Crested serpent eagle. All members within the species complex have a large looking head with long feathers on the back of the head giving them a maned and crested appearance. The face is bare and yellow joining up with the ceres while the powerful feet are unfeathered and heavily scaled. They fly over the forest canopy on broad wings and tail have wide white and black bars. They call often with a loud, piercing and familiar three or two-note call. They often feed on snakes, giving them their name and are placed along with the Circaetus snake-eagles in the subfamily Circaetinae."@en .

Based on grand jury testimony from Kevin Weeks's former associates, U.S. prosecutors indicted Bulger for 19 murders. Bulger is the brother of former President of the Massachusetts Senate Billy Bulger.Beginning in 1975, Bulger served as an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). As a result, the Bureau largely ignored his organization in exchange for information about the inner workings of the Italian American Patriarca crime family. Beginning in 1997, the New England media exposed criminal actions by federal, state, and local law enforcement officials tied to Bulger. For the FBI especially, this has caused great embarrassment. On December 23, 1994, after being tipped off by his former FBI handler about a pending indictment under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), Bulger fled Boston and went into hiding. For 16 years, he remained at large. For 12 of those years, Bulger was prominently listed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, 2nd behind Osama bin Laden.On June 22, 2011, Bulger was arrested outside an apartment in Santa Monica, California. Arrested with him was his longtime girlfriend Catherine Greig. Bulger was 81 years old at the time of his arrest. Soon after, Bulger and Greig were extradited to Massachusetts and brought under heavy guard to the waterfront federal courthouse. This necessitated the closing of part of Boston Harbor. Greig pleaded guilty to conspiracy to harboring a fugitive, identity fraud, and conspiracy to commit identity fraud and was sentenced in June 2012 to eight years in prison. Bulger did not seek bail and remained in custody at the Plymouth County House of Correction in Plymouth, Massachusetts. On November 5, 2012, Bulger was taken to a hospital from his Plymouth prison cell after complaining of chest pains.On June 12, 2013, Bulger went on trial for 32 counts of racketeering, money laundering, extortion, and weapons charges, including his complicity in 19 murders. On August 12, 2013, he was found guilty on 31 counts, including both racketeering charges, and was found to have been involved in 11 murders. On November 14, 2013, Bulger was sentenced to two consecutive life terms plus five years for his crimes by U.S. District Judge Denise Casper.  Bulger is now inmate number 02182-748 currently incarcerated for life at the United States Penitentiary Coleman II in Sumterville, Florida.Bulger is also possibly involved with the murder of an unidentified woman, dubbed \"Lady of the Dunes,\" who was murdered in Provincetown, Massachusetts, in 1974. After one of many facial reconstructions was released, it was reported that he was seen in the city with a woman who matched Lady of the Dune's description."@en .

Tom and Betsy Rath share a struggle to find contentment in their hectic and material culture while several other characters fight essentially the same battle, but struggle in it for different reasons. In the end, it is a story of taking responsibility for one's own life. The book was largely autobiographical, drawing on Wilson's experiences as assistant director of the U.S. National Citizen Commission for Public Schools.The novel was made into a movie in 1956, starring Gregory Peck and Jennifer Jones as Tom and Betsy Rath, with Fredric March, Lee J. Cobb, Keenan Wynn and Marisa Pavan in supporting roles. (March plays Tom Rath's boss, a character based on Roy Larsen, Wilson's boss at Time, Inc.) It was entered at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival.Both movie and book became hugely popular. The novel continues to appear in the references of sociologists to America's discontented businessman. Columnist Bob Greene wrote, \"The title of Sloan Wilson's best-selling novel became part of the American vernacular\u2014the book was a ground-breaking fictional look at conformity in the executive suite, and it was a piece of writing that helped the nation's business community start to examine the effects of its perceived stodginess and sameness.\" Historian Robert Schultz argues that the film and the novel are cultural representations of what two-time presidential candidate (1952 and 1956) Adlai Stevenson described in a 1955 commencement address to Smith College women as a \"crisis\" in the western world, one Stevenson defined as \"collectivism colliding with individualism,\" the collective corporate organization of postwar social and economic life. That increased corporate organization of society, Schultz notes, reduced white-collar workers' (represented by Tom Rath and the other gray-suited \"yes men\") control over what they did and how they did it as they adapted to the \"organized system\" described and critiqued by contemporary social critics such as Paul Goodman, C.

English-language_television_programming 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Knots_Landing> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Knots Landing is an American primetime television soap opera that aired from December 27, 1979 to May 13, 1993 on CBS. A spin-off of Dallas, it was set in a fictitious coastal suburb of Los Angeles, and centered on the lives of four married couples living in a cul-de-sac, Seaview Circle. By the time of its conclusion, Knots Landing had become one of the longest-running primetime dramas on U.S. television after Gunsmoke and Bonanza.Knots Landing was created by David Jacobs (one-time writer of Family and later producer of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman) in conjunction with producer Michael Filerman (who would also later co-produce Falcon Crest). Although it became a spin-off of Dallas, the concept predates that series, and was initially rebuffed by CBS in 1977, as the network wanted something more \"saga-like\". Jacobs then created Dallas, which the network accepted and premiered in 1978. After Dallas became a hit, Jacobs was then able to adapt Knots Landing as a spin-off series by way of incorporating characters originally introduced in the parent series. The series was largely inspired by a 1957 movie No Down Payment but also by the 1973 Ingmar Bergman television miniseries Scenes from a Marriage. Storylines included rape, murder, kidnapping, assassinations, drug smuggling, corporate intrigue and criminal investigations. Though initially not as popular as Dallas, Knots Landing eventually garnered much critical acclaim. The series peaked during the 1983\u201384 season with a 20.8 rating (finishing in 11th place) and a 20.0 rating for the 1984\u201385 season (when it finished 9th). This can be attributed, in part, to more dramatic storylines as the series became more soap-opera like, and the gradual inclusion of newer characters to interact with the original cast. By the 1988\u201389 season, Knots Landing was ahead of Dallas in the ratings, though audiences for both shows by this time were less than their earlier years.In 1997, much of the cast reunited for a two-part mini-series entitled Knots Landing: Back to the Cul-de-Sac. In 2005, they reunited again for the non-fiction special Knots Landing Reunion: Together Again in which the cast reminisced about their time on the show. Dallas itself was revived in 2012, with characters from Knots Landing appearing in its second season."@en .

He was secretary of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) between 1863 and 1888, and later served as the Society's president for a further 12 years. In the latter capacity he was mainly responsible for organising the National Antarctic Expedition of 1901\u201304, and for launching the polar career of Robert Falcon Scott.Markham began his career as a Royal Naval cadet and midshipman, during which time he went to the Arctic with HMS Assistance in one of the many searches for the lost expedition of Sir John Franklin. Later, Markham served as a geographer to the India Office, and was responsible for the collection of cinchona plants from their native Peruvian forests, and their transplantation in India. By this means the Indian government acquired a home source from which quinine could be extracted. Markham also served as geographer to Sir Robert Napier's Abyssinian expeditionary force, and was present in 1868 at the fall of Magdala.The main achievement of Markham's RGS presidency was the revival at the end of the 19th century of British interest in Antarctic exploration, after a 50-year interval. He had strong and determined ideas about how the National Antarctic Expedition should be organised, and fought hard to ensure that it was run primarily as a naval enterprise, under Captain Scott's command. To do this he overcame hostility and opposition from much of the scientific community. In the years following the expedition he continued to champion Scott's career, to the extent of disregarding or disparaging the achievements of other contemporary explorers.All his life Markham was a constant traveller and a prolific writer, his works including histories, travel accounts and biographies. He authored many papers and reports for the RGS, and did much editing and translation work for the Hakluyt Society, of which he also became president. He received public and academic honours, and was recognised as a major influence on the discipline of geography, although it was acknowledged that much of his work was based on enthusiasm rather than scholarship. Among the geographical features bearing his name is Antarctica's Mount Markham, named after him by Scott in 1902."@en .

A decorated veteran of World War II, Mecham earned his living as an automotive dealership owner and occasional newspaper publisher. Periodic runs for political office earned him a reputation as a perennial candidate along with the nickname of \"The Harold Stassen of Arizona\" before he was elected governor, under the Republican banner. As governor, Mecham was plagued by controversy and became the first U.S. governor to simultaneously face removal from office through impeachment, a scheduled recall election, and a felony indictment. He was the first Arizona governor to be impeached.Mecham served one term as a state senator before beginning a string of unsuccessful runs for public office. His victory during the 1986 election began with a surprise win of the Republican nomination, followed by a split of the Democratic party during the general election, resulting in a 3-way race. While governor, Mecham became known for statements and actions that were widely perceived as insensitive to minorities. Among these actions were the cancellation of the state's paid Martin Luther King, Jr. Day and creating an unpaid King holiday on a Sunday, attributing high divorce rates to working women, and his defense of the word \"pickaninny\", in describing African American children. In reaction to these events, a boycott of Arizona was organized. A rift between the governor and fellow Republicans in the Arizona Legislature developed after the Arizona Republic newspaper made accusations of questionable political appointments and accusations of cronyism against the governor, accusations that Mecham contended were false.Having served from January 6, 1987, to April 4, 1988, Mecham was removed from office following conviction in his impeachment trial of charges of the obstruction of justice and the misuse of government funds - funds that Mecham maintained were private. A later criminal trial acquitted Mecham of related charges. Following his removal from office, Mecham remained active in politics for nearly a decade. During this time, he served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention and made his final runs for Governor and for the U.S. Senate."@en .

He has cited as influences American poets including Robert Frost and Elizabeth Bishop (herself an international poet with ties to the U.S., Canada, and Brazil). In addition to writing poetry, he has translated Giacomo Leopardi and\u2014with his wife, Vassar classicist Rachel Kitzinger\u2014Sophocles's Oedipus at Colonus.Grennan studied at University College, Dublin, where he met poets Derek Mahon and Eavan Boland, and at Harvard University, and began teaching at Vassar in 1974. He returned to Ireland fairly briefly, first in 1977 and later in 1981, and began writing poetry there. His first book, Wildly for Days, was published in 1983. Gaelic poetry became an important influence, particularly, he has said, on the sound of his poems. At the same time, he is interested in the sentence as a poetic unit as well as a prose unit.

With 409 victories, Paterno is the winningest coach in FBS history.  His career ended with his dismissal from the team as a result of  the Penn State child sex abuse scandal.Paterno was born in Brooklyn, New York and attended Brown University, where he played football both as the quarterback and a cornerback. Originally planning to be a lawyer, he instead signed on as an assistant football coach at Penn State in 1950, persuaded by his college coach Rip Engle who had taken over as Penn State's head coach. In 1966, Paterno was named as Engle's successor. He soon coached the team to two undefeated regular seasons in 1968 and 1969. The team won two national championships\u2014in 1982 and 1986. Paterno coached five undefeated teams that won major bowl games and, in 2007, was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach. In all, he led the Nittany Lions to 37 bowl appearances with 24 wins while turning down offers to coach National Football League (NFL) teams, including the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots.After the child sex abuse scandal involving his former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky broke in full in November 2011, Paterno announced he would retire at the end of the season. However, on November 9, the Penn State Board of Trustees rejected this offer and fired him, effective immediately. An investigation conducted by former FBI director Louis Freeh concluded in July 2012 that Paterno concealed facts relating to Sandusky's sexual abuse of young boys. The investigation also uncovered information that Paterno may havepersuaded university officials not to report Sandusky to authorities in 2001. On July 23, 2012, the NCAA vacated all of Penn State's wins from 1998 through 2011 as part of its punishment for the child sex abuse scandal, eliminating 111 of the games Paterno had coached and won, dropping him from first to 12th on the list of winningest NCAA football coaches. The NCAA reversed its decision on January 16, 2015 and restored the 111 wins to Paterno's record.Paterno died of complications from lung cancer on January 22, 2012, only two months after his firing."@en .

He was elected on a split ticket with Republican Louie B. Nunn. Four years later, Ford defeated Combs in an upset in the Democratic primary en route to the governorship.As governor, Ford made government more efficient by reorganizing and consolidating some departments in the executive branch. He raised revenue for the state through a severance tax on coal and enacted reforms to the educational system. He purged most of the Republicans from statewide office, including helping Walter \"Dee\" Huddleston win the Senate seat vacated by the retirement of Republican stalwart John Sherman Cooper. In 1974, Ford himself ousted the other incumbent senator, Republican Marlow Cook. Following the rapid rise of Ford and many of his political allies, he and his lieutenant governor, Julian Carroll, were investigated on charges of political corruption, but a grand jury refused to indict them. As senator, Ford was a staunch defender of Kentucky's tobacco industry. He also formed the Senate National Guard Caucus with Missouri senator Kit Bond. Chosen as Democratic party whip in 1991, Ford considered running for floor leader in 1994 before throwing his support to Connecticut's Christopher Dodd. He retired from the Senate in 1999 and returned to Owensboro, where he taught politics to youth at the Owensboro Museum of Science and History."@en .

In a career spanning over 20 years, he played for Wimbledon, Leicester City, Millwall, Southampton, Coventry City and, most notably, Chelsea. During his time at Stamford Bridge, Wise won two FA Cups, a League Cup and a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, becoming the club's most successful captain, although has since been overtaken by John Terry.He also played at international level for much of his career, representing England over a period of ten years. Wise won 21 caps and scored once, on his debut against Turkey on 1 May 1991. He was in the national squad for Euro 2000 and played in group games against Germany (won 1\u20130) and Romania (lost 2\u20133).In the latter years of his playing career, Wise gradually became involved in the managerial aspects of the game, starting at Millwall, where he took on the role of player-manager, taking them to the F.A. Cup final and European football for the first time ever. He was briefly caretaker manager at Southampton, following the departure of Harry Redknapp, before he took over the reins at Swindon Town on a permanent basis. In October 2006, he was appointed manager of the then-Championship side Leeds United, who found themselves in the relegation zone. Although they were ultimately relegated, Wise reshaped his side in the close season and Leeds made an excellent start to their first season in the third tier of English football.In a surprise career move, despite their strong position and likelihood of promotion, Wise left Leeds in January 2008 to join the newly reshaped management team at Newcastle United in an executive role, tasked with travelling around Europe and further afield identifying young players and developing the academy. Wise left Newcastle on 1 April 2009. Following the situation that led to his departure, Wise admitted \"It has all had a damaging effect on my career\"."@en .

It was initially discovered in 1949 as an comet and then lost to further observations. Thirty years later it was rediscovered as an asteroid, after which it took over an decade to determine that these observations were of the same object. Therefore it has both an comet designation and an asteroid designation, and with a name length of 17 characters it is currently the asteroid with the longest name, having one more character than the 16-character limit imposed by the IAU.The comet was discovered on November 19, 1949, by Albert G. Wilson and Robert G. Harrington at Palomar Observatory.  Only three photographic observations were obtained and the comet was lost (insufficient observations to determine a precise enough orbit to know where to look for future appearances of the comet, see Lost comet).On November 15, 1979, an apparent Mars-crosser asteroid was found by Eleanor F. Helin, also of Palomar Observatory. It received the designation 1979 VA, and when re-observed on December 20, 1988, received the permanent number 4015.On August 13, 1992, it was reported that asteroid (4015) 1979 VA and comet 107P/Wilson\u2013Harrington were the same object. By then, enough observations of the asteroid had been accumulated to obtain a fairly precise orbit, and the search of old photographic plates for pre-discovery images turned up the 1949 plates with the images of the lost comet.Although the 1949 images show cometary features, all subsequent images show only a stellar image, suggesting it may be an inactive comet that undergoes only infrequent outbursts.The eccentricity is 0.624, which is somewhat higher than that of a typical asteroid-belt minor planet and more typical of periodic comets.There are only four other objects that are cross-listed as both comets and asteroids: 2060 Chiron (95P/Chiron), Comet 133P/Elst\u2013Pizarro (7968 Elst\u2013Pizarro), 60558 Echeclus (174P/Echeclus), and 118401 LINEAR (176P/LINEAR). As a dual status object, astrometric observations of 4015 Wilson\u2013Harrington should be reported under the minor planet designation.A flyby of 4015 Wilson\u2013Harrington was formerly planned by Deep Space 1. It was also considered for the NEAR mission."@en .

Its orbit keeps it within the asteroid belt, yet it displayed a dust tail like a comet while near perihelion in 1996, 2001, and 2007. As a comet it is formally designated 133P/Elst\u2013Pizarro. As an asteroid it is designated 7968 Elst\u2013Pizarro.Elst\u2013Pizarro was reported in 1979 as minor planet 1979 OW7, with its image on a photographic plate being completely stellar in appearance. Its orbit remains entirely within the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, with eccentricity 0.165, typical of a minor planet in the asteroid belt.  However, the images taken by Eric W. Elst and Guido Pizarro in 1996, when it was near perihelion, clearly show a cometary tail. Since this is not normal behaviour for asteroids, it is suspected that Elst\u2013Pizarro has a different, probably icy, composition. The cometary nature of Elst\u2013Pizarro was first discovered on 1996 August 7 when a linear dust feature was observed.Subsequently, around the next perihelion in November 2001, the cometary activity appeared again, and persisted for 5 months.At present, there are only four other objects that are cross-listed as both comets and asteroids: 2060 Chiron (95P/Chiron), 4015 Wilson\u2013Harrington (107P/Wilson-Harrington), 60558 Echeclus (174P/Echeclus), and 118401 LINEAR (176P/LINEAR, previously 1999 RE70).

As gas expands to drive out the payload, only some propellant evaporates inside the can to maintain an even pressure. Outside the can, the droplets of propellant evaporate rapidly, leaving the payload suspended as very fine particles or droplets.

After the death of his father, he was apprenticed from 1814 to 1821 to a merchant in Liverpool. He then made his fortune as a beer brewer, which enabled him to indulge his interest in astronomy. He built an observatory at his house \"Starfield\" in West Derby, a suburb of Liverpool. There he had a 24-inch (610 mm) reflector telescope, for which he pioneered the use of an equatorial mount for easy tracking of objects as the Earth rotates.  He ground and polished the mirror himself, using equipment he constructed. The observatory was later (1854) moved further out of Liverpool, to Bradstone.In 1846 Lassell discovered Triton, the largest moon of Neptune, just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself by German astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle. In 1848 he independently co-discovered Hyperion, a moon of Saturn. In 1851 he discovered Ariel and Umbriel, two moons of Uranus.When Queen Victoria visited Liverpool in 1851, Lassell was the only local she specifically requested to meet.In 1855, he built a 48-inch (1,200 mm) telescope, which he installed in Malta because of the observing conditions that were better than in often overcast England. On his return to the UK after several years in Malta he moved to Maidenhead and operated his 24-inch (610 mm) telescope in an observatory there.He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1849, and served as its president for two years starting in 1870. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1849 and won their Royal Medal in 1858.Lassell died in Maidenhead in 1880. Upon his death, he left a fortune of \u00A380,000 (roughly equivalent to 8.8 million American dollars by today's standards). His telescope was presented to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.The crater Lassell on the Moon, a crater on Mars, the asteroid 2636 Lassell and a ring of Neptune are named in his honour."@en .

In particular, he hired Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Gerhard Herzberg who later became Nobel Prize winners. Struve's research was mostly focused on binary and variable stars, stellar rotation and interstellar matter. He was one of the few eminent astronomers in the pre-Space Age era to publicly express a belief that extraterrestrial intelligence was abundant, and so was an early advocate of the search for extraterrestrial life."@en .

Wansbrough's emphasis was on the critique of traditional accounts of the origins of Islam. Born in Peoria, Illinois, Wansbrough completed his studies at Harvard University, and spent the rest of his academic career at SOAS. He caused a furor in the 1970s when his research on early Islamic manuscripts, including the analysis of the repeated use of monotheistic Judeo-Christian imagery found in the Qur'an led him to posit that the rise of Islam was a mutation of what was originally a Judeo-Christian sect trying to spread in Arab lands, rather than by simple cultural diffusion. As time evolved the Judeo-Christian scriptures were adapted to an Arab perspective and mutated into what became the Qur'an which was developed over centuries with contributions from various Arab tribal sources. Wansbrough's research suggests that a great deal of the traditional history of Islam appeared to be a fabrication of later generations seeking to forge and justify a unique religious identity. Within this context, the character of Muhammad could be seen as a manufactured myth created to provide the Arab tribes with their own Arab version of the Judeo-Christian prophets.

Bad itself has sold between 30-45 million copies worldwide, certified 9 times Platinum in the United States alone, and has been cited as one of the 30 best-selling albums of all time. The album produced a record five Billboard Hot 100 number one singles, the first and one of only two albums to do so, the second being Katy Perry's 2010 album Teenage Dream. Similar to Jackson's previous music material, the album's music features elements of R&B, pop and rock.Bad was recorded during the first half of 1987. The lyrical themes on the record relate to paranoia, romance and self-improvement. Bad is widely regarded as having cemented Jackson's status as one of the most successful artists of the 1980s, as well as enhancing his solo career and being one of the best musical projects of his career. Nine of the eleven songs on Bad were released as singles; one was a promotional single and another was released outside of the United States and Canada. Five of the singles hit number one in the United States, while a sixth charted within the top-ten, and a seventh charted within the top-twenty on the Hot 100. The single that was released outside of the United States and Canada was commercially successful, charting within the top ten and top twenty in multiple territories. Bad peaked at number one in seven countries, as well as charting within the top twenty in other territories. The only songs on the album which were not released as a single were \"Speed Demon\" and \"Just Good Friends\", the latter being the only song on the album to also not have a music video accompanying it.Bad saw Jackson exercise even more artistic freedom than he did with his two previous Epic releases (Off the Wall and Thriller). On Bad, Jackson composed nine of the album's eleven tracks and received co-producer credit for the entire album. The album continued Jackson's commercial success in the late 1980s and garnered six Grammy Award nominations, winning two. Aside from commercial success the album also received critical acclaim from contemporary critics. Bad was ranked number 43 in the 100 Greatest Albums of All Time of the MTV Generation in 2009 by VH1 and number 202 in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

When it is twisted, it exerts a force (actually torque) in the opposite direction, proportional to the amount (angle) it is twisted.  There are two types.  A torsion bar is a straight bar of metal or rubber that is subjected to twisting (shear stress) about its axis by torque applied at its ends.  A more delicate form used in sensitive instruments, called a torsion fiber consists of a fiber of silk, glass, or quartz under tension, that is twisted about its axis.  The other type, a helical torsion spring, is a metal rod or wire in the shape of a helix (coil) that is subjected to twisting about the axis of the coil by sideways forces (bending moments) applied to its ends, twisting the coil tighter.  This terminology can be confusing because in a helical torsion spring the forces acting on the wire are actually bending stresses, not torsional (shear) stresses."@en .

It was released on June 16, 1995 by Epic Records. This is Jackson's first album on his own label, MJJ Productions, and consists of two discs: the first disc (HIStory Begins) is a compilation of some of his greatest hits from 1979 forward, while the second disc (HIStory Continues) is composed entirely of new material. The majority of the second disc's tracks were written and produced by Jackson, often in conjunction with collaborators.HIStory was Jackson's return to releasing music following the accusation of child sexual abuse in August 1993. Many of the 15 songs pertain to the accusations and Jackson's mistreatment in the media, specifically the tabloids. The songs' themes include environmental awareness, isolation, greed, and injustice.HIStory is Jackson's most controversial album. Jackson was accused of using anti-Semitic lyrics in \"They Don't Care About Us\". Jackson stated that he did not mean any offense and on multiple occasions denied anti-Semitism. The dispute regarding the lyrics ended with Jackson re-recording them. R. Kelly was accused of plagiarizing one of the album's songs, \"You Are Not Alone\". In 2007 a judge ruled that the song was plagiarized and the song was subsequently banned from radio stations in Belgium.Six singles and two promotional singles were released from HIStory: \"Scream\", \"You Are Not Alone\", \"Earth Song\", \"This Time Around\", \"They Don't Care About Us\" and \"Stranger in Moscow\". \"This Time Around\" was released as a radio-only single, and \"Earth Song\", \"They Don't Care About Us\" and \"Stranger in Moscow\" were less successful within the United States, but were successful internationally; all three peaked within the top ten in multiple countries.The album was generally well received by music critics, although the first disc received more acclaim than the newly created material on the second. The album was also commercially successful, debuting and peaking at number one in many counties, including the United States, Canada, Australia, France and the United Kingdom, as well as charting within the top ten in Spain, India and Mexico. The album was certified six times platinum by the end of 1996 in Europe, making it the best selling album of the year in the combined European market. The album was nominated for five Grammy Awards, winning one for Best Music Video \u2013 Short Form for \"Scream\". The greatest hits disc of the album was reissued as a single disc on November 13, 2001, under the name Greatest Hits: HIStory, Volume I and has reportedly sold four million copies worldwide as of early 2010."@en .

It was released on May 20, 1997 by Epic Records and is the second album released by Jackson's own record label, MJJ Productions. The album is made up of eight remixes from Jackson's previous studio album HIStory, and five new songs. Jackson was heavily involved with the production of the new material while the remixes were produced by other artists. The new material dealt with themes such as drug addiction, women and paranoia.The album received minimal promotion by Jackson's standards, particularly in the United States. Still, a film, two singles (\"Blood on the Dance Floor\" and \"HIStory/Ghosts\") and three music videos were issued as promotion. Reviews at the time of release were largely mixed, some critics felt that Jackson had already explored these musical themes while others criticized what they perceived as weak vocals. Other critics were favorable, with praise issued for similarities to the music of Marilyn Manson and Trent Reznor.Since its debut, the album has sold an estimated six million copies worldwide, making it the best selling remix album ever released. Several contemporary critics view the material in an increasingly favorable light and believe the album could have been more successful\u2014commentators argue that certain sections of the world took interest in tabloid stories about the singer's personal life over his musical career."@en .

He offered to show her work to his father, who owned a successful publishing company; however, she did not consider the offer to be serious. After multiple performances, however, Koppelman found a demo tape of her singing her single \"Talkin' Bout a Revolution\", which he promoted to radio stations, and she was eventually signed to Elektra Records.In early attempts to produce the first album, many producers turned down Chapman as they did not favor her musical direction.  David Kershenbaum, however, decided to produce it as he wanted to record an acoustic music album. It was recorded in Hollywood, California in only eight weeks.

He is best known for being the weaponeer on the Enola Gay, the aircraft which dropped the Little Boy atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan in 1945.A 1922 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, Parsons served on a variety of warships beginning with the battleship USS Idaho. He was trained in ordnance and studied ballistics under L.T.E. Thompson at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia. In July 1933, Parsons became liaison officer between the Bureau of Ordnance and the Naval Research Laboratory. He became interested in radar and was one of the first to recognize its potential to locate ships and aircraft, and perhaps even track shells in flight. In September 1940, Parsons and Merle Tuve of the National Defense Research Committee began work on the development of the proximity fuze, a radar-triggered fuze that would explode a shell in the proximity of the target. The fuze, eventually known as the VT (variable time) fuze, Mark 32, went into production in 1942. Parsons was on hand to watch the USS Helena shoot down the first enemy aircraft with a VT fuze in the Solomon Islands in January 1943.In June 1943, Parsons joined the Manhattan Project as Associate Director at the research laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico under J. Robert Oppenheimer. Parsons became responsible for the ordnance aspects of the project, including the design and testing of the non-nuclear components of nuclear weapons. In a reorganization in 1944, he lost responsibility for the implosion-type fission weapon, but retained that for the design and development of the gun-type fission weapon, which eventually became Little Boy. He was also responsible for the delivery program, codenamed Project Alberta. In August 1945 he participated in the bombing of Hiroshima as weaponeer on the B-29 Enola Gay. During the flight to Hiroshima, Parsons climbed into the bomb bay to load the powder charge, to avoid the possibility of a nuclear explosion if the aircraft crashed and burned on takeoff. He was awarded the Silver Star for his part in the mission.After the war, Parsons was promoted to the rank of rear admiral without ever having commanded a ship. He participated in Operation Crossroads, the nuclear weapon tests at Bikini Atoll in 1946, and later the Operation Sandstone tests at Enewetak Atoll in 1948. In 1947, he became deputy commander of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project. He died of a heart attack on 5 December 1953."@en .

He was a distinguished mathematician, physicist and astronomer, born in Boston, Mass. His great-great-grandfather, also named John Winthrop, was founder of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He graduated in 1732 from Harvard, where, from 1738 until his death he served as professor of mathematics and natural philosophy.  Professor Winthrop was one of the foremost men of science in America during the 18th century, and his impact on its early advance  in New England was particularly significant.  Both Benjamin Franklin and Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford) probably owed much of their early interest in scientific research to his influence.  He also had a decisive influence in the early philosophical education of John Adams, during the latter's time at Harvard.  He corresponded regularly with the Royal Society in London\u2014as such, one of the first American intellectuals of his time to be taken seriously in Europe. He was noted for attempting to explain the great Lisbon earthquake of 1755 as a scientific\u2014rather than religious\u2014phenomenon, and his application of mathematical computations to earthquake activity following the great quake has formed the basis of the claim made on his behalf as the founder of the science of seismology.  Additionally, he observed the transits of Mercury in 1740 and 1761 and journeyed to Newfoundland to observe a transit of Venus.  He traveled in a ship provided by the Province of Massachusetts - probably the first scientific expedition ever sent out by any incipient American state.  He served as acting president of Harvard in 1769 and again in 1773; but both times declined the offer of the full presidency on the grounds of old age. During the nine months in 1775-1776 when Harvard moved to Concord, Massachusetts, Winthrop occupied the house which was later to become famous as The Wayside, home to Louisa May Alcott and Nathaniel Hawthorne.  Additionally, he was actively interested in public affairs, was for several years a judge of probate in Middlesex County, was a member of the Governor's Council in 1773-74, and subsequently offered the weight of his influence to the patriotic cause in the Revolution.  He published:   Lecture on Earthquakes (1755) Answer to Mr. Prince's Letter on Earthquakes (1756) Account of Some Fiery Meteors (1755) Two Lectures on the Parallax (1769)In addition to his scientific and mathematical accomplishments, he also fathered a son, James Winthrop, who continued his father's political work."@en .

English-language_television_programming 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Twenty_Questions> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Twenty Questions is a spoken parlor game which encourages deductive reasoning and creativity. It originated in the United States and was played widely in the 19th century.  It escalated in popularity during the late 1940s when it became the format for a successful weekly radio quiz program.In the traditional game, one player is chosen to be the answerer. That person chooses a subject (object) but does not reveal this to the others. All other players are questioners. They each take turns asking a question which can be answered with a simple \"Yes\" or \"No.\" In variants of the game (see below), multiple state answers may be included such as the answer \"Maybe.\" The answerer answers each question in turn. Sample questions could be: \"Is it bigger than a breadbox?\" or \"Can I put it in my mouth?\" Lying is not allowed in the game. If a questioner guesses the correct answer, that questioner wins and becomes the answerer for the next round. If 20 questions are asked without a correct guess, then the answerer has stumped the questioners and gets to be the answerer for another round.Careful selection of questions can greatly improve the odds of the questioner winning the game. For example, a question such as \"Does it involve technology for communications, entertainment or work?\" can allow the questioner to cover a broad range of areas using a single question that can be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no\". If the answerer responds with \"yes,\" the questioner can use the next question to narrow down the answer; if the answerer responds with \"no,\" the questioner has successfully eliminated a number of possibilities for the answer."@en .

Variously described as idiosyncratic, and \"ridiculously smart,\" she was the state's first female governor and was known for her leadership of the state during the devastating eruption of Mt. St. Helens, for her strident support of atomic energy, and for her personal eccentricities.A graduate of Mills College and Stanford University, where she earned a doctorate in biology, Ray became an associate professor at the University of Washington in 1957. She was chief scientist aboard the schooner SS Te Vega during the International Indian Ocean Expedition. Under her guidance, the nearly-bankrupt Pacific Science Center was transformed from a traditional, exhibit-oriented museum to an interactive learning center, and returned to solvency.In 1973 Ray was appointed chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)  by President Richard M. Nixon. Under her leadership, research and development was separated from safety programs, and Milton Shaw, the head of the powerful reactor development division, was removed. She was appointed Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs by President Gerald Ford in 1975, but resigned six months later, complaining about lack of input into department decision making.To the surprise of many, Ray ran for election as Governor of Washington as a Democrat in 1976. She won the election despite her blunt, sometimes confrontational, style. As governor, she approved allowing supertankers to dock in Puget Sound, championed support for unrestrained growth and development, and continued to express enthusiasm for atomic energy. On April 3, 1980 she declared a state of emergency as a result of the volcanic eruption of Mount St. Helens. She retired after losing her bid for re-election in 1980."@en .

In many ways, Second Life is similar to MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games); however, Linden Lab is emphatic that their creation is not a game: \"There is no manufactured conflict, no set objective\".The virtual world can be accessed freely via Linden Lab's own client programs, or via alternative Third Party Viewers. Second Life users (also called Residents) create virtual representations of themselves, called avatars and are able to interact with other avatars, places or objects. They can explore the world (known as the grid), meet other residents, socialize, participate in individual and group activities, build, create, shop and trade virtual property and services with one another. It is a platform that principally features 3D-based user-generated content. Second Life also has its own virtual currency, the Linden Dollar, which is exchangeable with real world currency. Second Life is intended for people aged 16 and over, with the exception of 13\u201315-year-old users restricted to the Second Life region of a sponsoring institution (e.g. school).Built into the software is a three-dimensional modeling tool based on simple geometric shapes that allows residents to build virtual objects. There is also a procedural scripting language, Linden Scripting Language, which can be used to add interactivity to objects. Sculpted prims (sculpties), mesh, textures for clothing or other objects, animations, and gestures can be created using external software and imported. The Second Life terms of service provide that users retain copyright for any content they create, and the server and client provide simple digital rights management (DRM) functions. However, Linden Lab changed their terms of service in August 2013, to be able to use user-generated content for any purpose. The new terms of service prevents users from using textures from 3rd-party texture services, as some of them pointed out explicitly.Users can also photograph in Second Life with the camera technology the client programs have."@en .

The show is subsequently edited for such content when broadcast in syndication or on basic cable.

One example is the star V1057 Cyg, which became 6 magnitudes brighter and went from spectral type dKe to F-type supergiant.  These stars are named after their type-star, FU Orionis.The current model developed primarily by Lee Hartmann and Scott Jay Kenyon associates the FU Orionis flare with abrupt mass transfer from an accretion disc onto a young, low mass T Tauri star,. Mass accretion rates for these objects are estimated to be around 10\u22124 solar masses per year.  The rise time of these eruptions is typically on the order of 1 year, but can be much longer. The lifetime of this high-accretion, high-luminosity phase is on the order of decades. However, even with such a relatively short timespan, an FU Orionis object has yet to be observed shutting off. By comparing the number of FUor outbursts to the rate of star formation in the solar neighborhood, it is estimated that the average young star undergoes approximately 10\u201320 FUor eruptions over its lifetime.The prototypes of this class are: FU Orionis, V1057 Cygni, V1515 Cygni, and the recent addition the embedded protostar V1647 Orionis, which erupted in 2004 January."@en .

An adaptation of the 1944 novel by Margaret Landon, it was based on the fictionalized diaries of Anna Leonowens, an Anglo-Indian woman who claimed to be British and became governess in the Royal Court of Siam (now modern Thailand) during the 1860s. Darryl F. Zanuck read Landon's book in galleys and immediately bought the film rights.The story mainly concerns the culture clash of the Imperialist Victorian values of the British Empire with the supposedly autocratic rule of Siam's King Mongkut. The successful film starred Rex Harrison as the king and Irene Dunne as Anna.  At the 19th Academy Awards ceremony, the film received two Oscars; for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction (Lyle R. Wheeler, William S. Darling, Thomas Little, Frank E. Hughes). Nominations also went to Bernard Herrmann's score, to the screenplay and to supporting actress Gale Sondergaard.Landon's novel was later adapted by Rodgers and Hammerstein for their 1951 stage musical The King and I and subsequent 1956 film of the same name. American film director Andy Tennant remade the film in 1999 as Anna and the King with Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-fat.The portrayal of Tuptim in Anna and the King of Siam, is considerably less sympathetic than in the musical version The King and I, as the 1946 film shows animosity between Tuptim and Anna, while the musical makes her into a romantic character.  Also, Tuptim is ultimately executed cruelly by the king, following an episode in Leonowens's book, while in the musical, her fate is made ambiguous."@en .

It is the fourth Metal Gear game produced and directed by Kojima and the direct sequel to Metal Gear Solid. Its release was followed by an expanded edition, Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance for Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows. A direct sequel was released in 2008, titled Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots (with Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater being a prequel).The story revolves around the \"Big Shell\", a massive offshore clean-up facility that has been seized by a group of terrorists that call themselves \"Sons of Liberty\". They demand a massive ransom in exchange for the life of the President of the United States, and threaten to destroy the facility and create a cataclysmic environmental disaster if their demands are not met. The motives and identities of many of the antagonists and allies change rapidly, as the protagonists discover a world-shaking conspiracy constructed by a powerful organization known as the Patriots.The game was critically acclaimed, shipping over 7 million copies worldwide and scoring an average Metacritic aggregate score of 96%, making it the fourth highest-rated game on the PlayStation 2, and tied for the sixth highest-rated game of all time. While the gameplay was universally acclaimed, critics were divided on the philosophical nature and execution of the game's storyline, which explores themes such as memes, social engineering, political conspiracies, censorship, and artificial intelligence. It has been considered an early example of a postmodern video game. Its protagonist also was met with a mixed reception."@en .

Laurent\", an obscure figure about whom little is known. Laurent made the discovery from the private observatory of Benjamin Valz in N\u00EEmes, France. The house, at 32 rue Nationale in N\u00EEmes, has a plaque commemorating the discovery. With Laurent's permission, Valz named the asteroid after the Celtic god Nemausus, the patron god of N\u00EEmes during Roman times.Based upon its spectrum, this is listed as a C-type asteroid in the Tholen classification taxonomy, and as a Cgh by Bus and Binzel (2002). This indicates a composition similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Absorption features in the spectrum indicate the presence of phyllosilicates. It may have a water content of about 14%.On August 17, 1979, the star SAO 144417 was occulted by 51 Nemausa. Photometric observation of this event from the Gissar and Alma-Ata observatories produced two chords, which were used to estimate a diameter of 150 km for the asteroid. This is close to the present-day estimate of 147.9 km. Lightcurve data suggests that it may have a small moon. Nemausa has been studied by radar."@en .

Mission Hill was formerly known as The Downtowners, although MTV's production of the similarly titled Downtown forced a name change.It has also been popular outside of the United States and Canada, receiving broadcasts in Australia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Spain and New Zealand.Stylistically, the series is recognizable for its bright, neon color palette, and features a peculiar mixture of modern animation and traditional \"cartoonish\" drawings (dashed lines coming from eyes to indicate line of vision, red bolts of lightning around a spot in pain).The show was created by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, former executive producers of The Simpsons, and the artistic designer was Lauren MacMullan.

Degrassi is the fourth fictional series in the Degrassi franchise, following The Kids of Degrassi Street, Degrassi Junior High, and Degrassi High.Like its predecessors, Degrassi: The Next Generation follows an ensemble cast of students at Degrassi Community School who face various challenges often seen as taboo such as sex, teen pregnancy, date rape, drug abuse, self image, homosexuality, self-injury, suicide, abortion, domestic violence, death and many other issues. The series was created by Linda Schuyler and Yan Moore, and is produced by Epitome Pictures (a subsidiary of DHX Media) in association with Bell Media. The current executive producers are Schuyler, her husband Stephen Stohn and Brendon Yorke. The series is filmed at Epitome's studios in Toronto, Ontario, rather than on the real De Grassi Street from which the franchise takes its name.A critical success, Degrassi: The Next Generation has often received favorable reviews from Entertainment Weekly, The New York Times, and AfterElton.com. In its initial years, it was frequently the most watched domestic drama series in Canada, and one of the highest-rated shows on TeenNick in the United States. In 2004, one episode received just under a million viewers in Canada, and over half a million viewers in the US. The series has won numerous awards, from the Geminis, Writers Guild of Canada and Directors Guild of Canada, and internationally from the Teen Choice Awards, Young Artist Awards, and Prix Jeunesse. The series premiered on CTV on October 14, 2001. During the ninth season in 2010, the series moved to MuchMusic.

The film is set in an alternative 1939 and follows the adventures of Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), a newspaper reporter, and Joseph \"Joe\" Sullivan (Jude Law), alias \"Sky Captain,\" as they track down the mysterious Dr. Totenkopf (Laurence Olivier), who is seeking to build the \"World of Tomorrow\". The film is an example of the \"dieselpunk\" genre.Conran spent four years making a black and white teaser trailer with a bluescreen set up in his living room and using a Macintosh IIci personal computer. He was able to show it to producer Jon Avnet, who was so impressed that he spent two years working with the aspiring filmmaker on his screenplay. No major studio was interested in financing such an unusual film with a first-time director. Avnet convinced Aurelio De Laurentiis to finance Sky Captain without a distribution deal.Almost 100 digital artists, modelers, animators and compositors created the multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for the live-action footage while the entire movie was sketched out via hand-drawn storyboards and then re-created as computer-generated 3D animatics. Ten months before Conran made the movie with his cast, he shot it entirely with stand-ins in Los Angeles and then created it in animatics so the actors had an idea of what the film would look like. Sky Captain is notable as one of the first major films (along with the earlier spring releases of 2004's Casshern and Immortal, and 2005's Sin City) to be shot entirely on a \"digital backlot\", blending live actors with computer-generated surroundings."@en .

He was once attacked and beaten by a street gang leaving him so covered in blood that a priest was called to administer the last rites. He attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on an academic scholarship from the Pullman railroad car company.  He graduated with his bachelor's degree in engineering in 1958.After graduation he went to work for the Douglas Aircraft Company.  He eventually moved to Motorola, then to Fairchild Semiconductor.In 1968 Sherman Fairchild brought a new management team into Fairchild Semiconductor, led by C. Lester Hogan, then vice president of Motorola Semiconductor. The staff from Motorola, also known as \"Hogan's Heroes\", were conservative and hence immediately clashed with Sanders' boisterous style.In 1969 a group of Fairchild engineers decided to start a new company, which became Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). They asked Jerry Sanders to join them, and he said he would, provided he became the president of the company.  Although it caused some dissension within the group, they agreed, and the company was founded with Sanders as President.Sanders took his trademark style into his position as the CEO of AMD. He loved visiting the Los Angeles sales office on Wilshire Blvd near Hollywood and staying at the Beverly Hills Hilton.  Sanders always wanted to make money, but he realized that the key to earning wealth was for everyone else at AMD to make a lot of money too.  While growing wealthy, he also lavished wealth generously on all his employees.  At the end of the company's first $1 million quarter, Sanders stood by the door of the company and handed a $100 bill to every employee as they left.  Every employee at the company got stock options, a huge innovation at the time.Sanders gave the company a strong sales and marketing orientation, so that it was successful even though it was often a little behind its competitors in technology and manufacturing.  He shared the success of the company with the employees, usually coincident with sales-oriented growth targets.  One time, as a successful sales goal was met, the company held a drawing among all the employees, and an immigrant production worker in Sunnyvale, California won $1000 a month for 20 years (USD 240,000).He drove the company through hard times as well. In 1974, a particularly bad recession almost broke the company. Through many difficult recessions he refused to lay off employees, a reaction to the rampant layoffs that had occurred at Fairchild earlier.  Instead of cutting employees, he asked them to work Saturdays to get more done and get new products out sooner.In 1982, he was responsible for a licensing deal with Intel that made AMD a second source to IBM for the Intel Microprocessor series, a deal that eventually made the company the only real competitor to Intel.In 2000, Sanders recruited H\u00E9ctor Ruiz, at the time the president of Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector, to serve as AMD's president and chief operating officer, and to become heir apparent to lead the company upon Sanders' retirement. Ruiz succeeded Sanders in the CEO's seat in 2002.Jerry Sanders has four children (three from his first marriage and one from his second), three who are now adults and one who is currently living with him and his wife, Tawny, and his daughter Paris.His maxim was: \"people first, products and profit will follow!\" This was given as a printout for each AMD worker who started a job at AMD in Dresden until Jerry Sanders retirement."@en .

It is fairly compact compared with other city centers on the West Coast of the United States because of its geographical situation. It is hemmed in on the north and east by hills, on the west by Elliott Bay, and on the south by reclaimed land that was once tidal flats. It is bounded on the north by Denny Way, beyond which are Lower Queen Anne (sometimes known as \"Uptown\"), Seattle Center, and South Lake Union; on the east by Broadway Avenue, beyond which is Capitol Hill to the northeast and the Central District to the east; on the south by Dearborn Avenue, beyond which is Sodo; and on the west by Elliott Bay, which is part of Puget Sound (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean). Belltown, Denny Triangle, the retail district, the West Edge, the financial district, the government district, Pioneer Square, Chinatown, Japantown, Little Saigon, and the western flank of First Hill west of Broadway consist of downtown Seattle's chief neighbourhoods. Near the center of downtown is the Metropolitan Tract, owned by the University of Washington, the location of the university's pre-1895 campus. Downtown is Seattle's finance hub, its commercial maritime hub, its centre of nightlife, and its centre of shopping. (The downtown shopping mall Westlake Center is connected to Seattle Center by way of a monorail). The area is also home to the landmark Pike Place Market, the oldest continually-operating farmer's market in the United States and the core of activity in the area.Downtown Seattle's Columbia Center has a greater number of floors than any other building west of the Mississippi River, at 76, though there are taller buildings in Texas and California by height. (Smith Tower, in the older section of downtown called Pioneer Square, once held the title of tallest American building west of the Mississippi.) Other notable buildings are the Washington Mutual Tower, Two Union Square, Nordstrom\u2019s flagship store, Benaroya Hall, the Seattle Central Library designed by Rem Koolhaas, and the main building of the Seattle Art Museum (built 1991, expanded 2007), the main facade of which was designed by Robert Venturi.

Originally commercial and subscription-driven, Shadowbane was launched in March 2003, and was the creation of text-MUD veterans J. Todd Coleman, James Nance, Josef Hall, Patrick Blanton and Robert Marsa and a team of 45 programmers, designers, artists and featured music by composer David Beaupre. It closed on July 1, 2009.Shadowbane was a top-10 best selling PC game at launch, and had two noteworthy aspects. First, the majority of the game world allowed for open player versus player combat, making it an early pioneer title in the PvP MMO genre.  Second, it was the first major MMO to offer dynamic world content as a primary feature of the game. Most MMOs are static, meaning the world itself does not change based on player actions. Dynamic worlds allow player to change the game world itself; morphing terrain, building and destroying buildings and fortifications, and setting up patrol paths for player-hired AI combatants. The game was considered a \"cult hit\" and sustained a small base of followers, but technical issues plagued the game at launch and failed to retain much of the early fanbase shortly afterward.After the sale of Wolfpack Studios to Ubi Soft in March 2004, the live service was transitioned to a new management and (largely new) development team, led by Frank Lucero and Ala Diaz. This team later splintered off to become Stray Bullet Games in June 2006, and Mark Nuasha was brought in to run the organization. On March 15, 2006 the game was made free-to-play. A system of short ads was introduced on March 6, 2007 to fund operating costs, which are displayed when the game is opened or closed and when a character dies (with at least 10 minutes between death ads). On March 19, 2008, all servers were closed to prepare for the \"Shadowbane Reboot,\" a relaunching of the game to capitalize on stability and performance gains hindered by previously existing data. All player characters and cities were deleted in this reboot. On March 25, 2008, the fifth anniversary of the game's launch, two servers were brought online followed by a third due to overpopulation. The game was closed the following July.The regular game took place in a dark fantasy world called Aerynth (the world will sometimes depend on the servers, many of which have unique world maps). Gameplay features many aspects typical of role-playing video games, such as experience points, character classes, and fantasy races. Character creation was fairly extensive, allowing for detailed, differentiable characters to be created."@en .

Looking to transition from the teen pop styles of her self-titled debut album (1999), Aguilera took creative control over her next album project, both musically and lyrically. She also changed her public image and established her new alter ego, \"Xtina\". Musically, its music incorporates pop and R&B with influences from many different genres, including soul, metal, rock, hip hop, gospel and Latin. Lyrically, most of the songs from the album discuss the theme of self-respect, while a few other songs talk about sex and feminism. As executive producer, Aguilera enlisted many new collaborators for the album.Upon its release, Stripped received generally mixed reviews from music critics, most of them criticized its lack of musical focus, while some of them called it an album for grown-ups. However, the album received multiple Grammy Award nominations, including one win. Commercially, Stripped debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 330,000 copies. Consequently, it was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping over four million copies in the region alone. The album also charted within the top five of charts in Canada, Europe, the Netherlands, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It was Aguilera's best-performing album in the United Kingdom, becoming the 29th best-selling album of the 2000s decade there with 1.9 million copies sold. As of 2006, Stripped has sold over 12 million copies worldwide.Five singles were released from the album. The lead single, \"Dirrty\", was met with mixed reviews from critics due to its sound and criticism due to its sexual music video. The follow-up, \"Beautiful\", was praised by critics and garnered chart success worldwide. The third single, \"Fighter\", became Aguilera's third top-ten hit worldwide from Stripped. The two last singles from Stripped were \"Can't Hold Us Down\" and \"The Voice Within\", which performed moderately on charts. Aguilera performed several songs from Stripped live during a number of shows, notably during the 2002 MTV Europe Music Awards, the American Music Awards of 2003, and the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. Two concert tours were held to promote the album, The Justified and Stripped Tour (2003) and The Stripped Tour (2003)."@en .

The story follows two friends, Mike and Scott, as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them to Mike's hometown in Idaho and then to Italy in search of Mike's mother.Van Sant originally wrote the screenplay in the 1970s, but discarded it after reading John Rechy's 1963 novel, City of Night, and concluding that Rechy's treatment of the subject of street hustlers was better than his own. Over the years, Van Sant rewrote the script, which comprised two stories: that of Mike and the search for his mother, and Scott's story as a modern update of the Henry IV plays. Van Sant had difficulty getting Hollywood financing, and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids. He sent copies of his script to Reeves and to Phoenix, assuming that they would turn it down, but both agreed to star in the film.My Own Private Idaho had its premiere at the 1991 Venice Film Festival, and received largely positive reviews, from critics including Roger Ebert and those of The New York Times and Entertainment Weekly. The film was a moderate financial success, grossing over $6.4 million in North America, which was above its estimated budget of $2.5 million. Phoenix received several awards for his performance in the film, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival, Best Male Lead from the Independent Spirit Awards, and Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics."@en .

His other noteworthy films include Royal Wedding, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Funny Face, Indiscreet, Damn Yankees!, Charade, and Two for the Road. He received an Honorary Academy Award in 1998 for his body of work and a Career Golden Lion from the Venice Film Festival in 2004. He was hailed by film critic David Quinlan as \"the King of the Hollywood musicals\". Donen married five times and had three children. His current long term partner is film director and comedian Elaine May.He began his career in the chorus line on Broadway for director George Abbott, where he befriended Kelly. In 1943 he went to Hollywood and worked as a choreographer before he and Kelly made On the Town in 1949. He then worked as a contract director for MGM under producer Arthur Freed producing hit films amid critical acclaim, both as a solo director and with Kelly. In 1952 Donen and Kelly co-directed the musical Singin' in the Rain, regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. Donen's relationship with Kelly deteriorated in 1955 during their final collaboration on It's Always Fair Weather. He then broke his contract with MGM to become an independent producer in 1957. As musicals began to lose public appeal, Donen switched to comedies. He continued to make hit films until the late 1960s, after which his career slowed down. He briefly returned to the stage as a director in the 1990s and again in 2002.Donen is credited with transitioning Hollywood musical films from realistic backstage dramas to a more integrated art form in which the songs were a natural continuation of the story. Before Donen and Kelly made their films, musicals (such as the extravagant and stylized work of Busby Berkeley) were often set in a Broadway stage environment where the musical numbers were part of a stage show. Donen and Kelly's films created a more cinematic form and included dances that could only be achieved in the film medium. Donen stated that what he was doing was a \"direct continuation from the Astaire \u2013 Rogers musicals ... which in turn came from Ren\u00E9 Clair and from Lubitsch ... What we did was not geared towards realism but towards the unreal.\" Film critic Jean-Pierre Coursodon has said that Donen's contribution to the evolution of the Hollywood musical \"outshines anybody else's, including Vincent Minnelli's.\" He is the last surviving notable director of Hollywood's Golden Age."@en .

The idea of the race was devised by the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, and a prize fund of $75,000 was put up by Sir Macpherson Robertson, a wealthy Australian confectionery manufacturer, on the conditions that the race be named after his MacRobertson confectionery company, and that it be organised to be as safe as possible.The race was organised by the Royal Aero Club, and would run from RAF Mildenhall in East Anglia to Flemington Racecourse, Melbourne, approximately 11,300 miles (18,200 km). There were five compulsory stops at Baghdad, Allahabad, Singapore, Darwin and Charleville, Queensland; otherwise the competitors could choose their own routes. A further 22 optional stops were provided with stocks of fuel and oil by Shell and Stanavo. The Royal Aero Club put some effort into persuading the countries along the route to improve the facilities at the stopping points.The basic rules were: no limit to the size of aircraft or power, no limit to crew size, no pilot to join aircraft after it left England. Aircraft must carry three days' rations per crew member, floats, smoke signals and efficient instruments. There were prizes for the outright fastest aircraft, and for the best performance on a handicap formula by any aircraft finishing within 16 days.Take off date was set at dawn (6:30), 20 October 1934. By then, the initial field of over 60 had been whittled down to 20, including the three purpose-built de Havilland DH.88 Comet racers, two of the new generation of American all-metal passenger transports, and a mixture of earlier racers, light transports and old bombers.First off the line, watched by a crowd of 60,000, were Jim and Amy Mollison in the Comet Black Magic, and they were early leaders in the race until forced to retire at Allahabad with engine trouble. This left the scarlet Comet Grosvenor House, flown by Flight Lt. C. W. A. Scott and Captain Tom Campbell Black, well ahead of the field. This racer went on to win in a time of less than 3 days, despite flying the last stage with one engine throttled back because of an oil-pressure indicator giving a faulty low reading. It would have won the handicap prize as well, were it not for a race rule that no aircraft could win more than one prize.Perhaps more significantly in the development of popular long-distance air travel, the second and third places were taken by passenger transports flying regular routes with passengers, with the KLM Douglas DC-2 PH-AJU Uiver (Stork) gaining a narrow advantage over Roscoe Turner's Boeing 247-D, both completing the course less than a day behind the winner.The most dramatic part of the race was when the Uiver, hopelessly lost after becoming caught in a thunderstorm, ended up over Albury, New South Wales. The townsfolk responded magnificently - Lyle Ferris, the chief electrical engineer of the post office, went to the power station and signalled \"Albury\" to the plane by turning the town lights on and off, and Arthur Newnham, the announcer on radio station 2CO Corowa, appealed for cars to line up on the racecourse to light up a runway for the plane.  The plane landed, and next morning was pulled out of the mud by locals to fly on and win the handicap section of the race. In gratitude KLM made a large donation to Albury Hospital and Alf Waugh, the Mayor of Albury, was awarded a title in Dutch nobility.Later that year (1934), the DC-2 crashed near Rutbah Wells, (now known as Ar Rutba, Iraq), and is now commemorated by a flying replica."@en .

It is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes.The occurrence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a significant cause of sudden unexpected cardiac death in any age group and as a cause of disabling cardiac symptoms. Younger people are likely to have a more severe form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.HCM is frequently asymptomatic until sudden cardiac death, and for this reason some suggest routinely screening certain populations for this disease.A cardiomyopathy is a  disease that affects the muscle of the heart. With HCM, the myocytes (cardiac contractile cells) in the heart increase in size, which results in the thickening of the heart muscle. In addition, the normal alignment of muscle cells is disrupted, a phenomenon known as myocardial disarray. HCM also causes disruptions of the electrical functions of the heart. HCM is most commonly due to a mutation in one of 9 sarcomeric genes that results in a mutated protein in the sarcomere, the primary component of the myocyte (the muscle cell of the heart). These are predominantly single-point missense mutations in the genes for beta-myosin heavy chain (MHC), myosin-binding protein C, cardiac troponinT, or tropomyosin. These mutations cause myofibril and myocyte structural abnormalities and possible deficiencies in force generation.While most literature so far focuses on European, American, and Japanese populations, HCM appears in all racial groups. The prevalence of HCM is about 0.2% to 0.5% of the general population."@en .

Major_League_Baseball_pitchers 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goose_Gossage> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Richard Michael \"Goose\" Gossage (born July 5, 1951) is a former Major League Baseball right-handed relief pitcher. During a 22-year baseball career (from 1972-1994), he pitched for nine different teams, spending his best years with the New York Yankees and San Diego Padres. The nickname \"Goose\" came about when a friend did not like his previous nickname \"Goss\", and noted he looked like a goose when he extended his neck to read the signs given by the catcher when he was pitching. Although Gossage is otherwise generally referred to as \"Rich\" in popular media, a baseball field named after him bears the name \"Rick\".In the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was one of the earliest manifestations of the dominating modern closer, with wild facial hair and a gruff demeanor to go along with his blistering fastball. He led the American League in saves three times and was runner-up twice; by the end of the 1987 season he ranked second in major-league career saves, trailing only Rollie Fingers, although by the end of his career his total of 310 had slipped to fourth all-time. When he retired he also ranked third in major-league career games pitched (1,002), and he remains third in wins in relief (115) and innings pitched in relief (1,556\u2154); his 1,502 strikeouts place him behind only Hoyt Wilhelm among pitchers who pitched primarily in relief. He also is the career leader in blown saves (112).  From 1977 through 1983 he never recorded an earned run average over 2.62, including a mark of 0.77 in 1981, and in 1980 he finished third in AL voting for both the MVP Award and Cy Young Award as the Yankees won a division title.Respected for his impact in crucial games, Gossage recorded the final out to clinch a division, league, or World Series title seven times. His eight All-Star selections as a reliever were a record until Mariano Rivera passed him in 2008; he was also selected once as a starting pitcher. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008. He now works in broadcasting."@en .

The series had encore presentations on CNBC and Bravo.Celebrity chef Rocco DiSpirito opened the Gramercy Park, New York City, restaurant Union Pacific in August, 1997. The NBC series, it was announced, would follow DiSpirito as he launched and operated a new Manhattan restaurant. The first season revolved around the construction and opening of Rocco's on 22nd, scheduled to open in five weeks. Some 7.5 million viewers tuned in for the July 20, 2003 premiere focusing on the search for a location and construction work for the new restaurant.Among the 2000 people who showed up hoping to be hired were various actors, models and show business hopefuls. In addition to Rocco's mother, Nicolina DiSpirito, known for her famous meatballs, the show's on-camera personnel included David Miller \"Michael Miller's little bro\" (Sous-chef), Alex Corrado (Maitre d'), Domiziano Arcangeli (Himself), Heather Kristin (Waitress), Natalie Norman (Waitress), Topher Goodman (Waiter), Lisa Wurzel (Herself), Brian Allen (Himself), Gideon Horowitz (Waiter), Heather Snell (Bartender), Amanda Congdon (Coat-check attendant), Pete Giovine (Waiter), Uzay Tumer (Captain), Emily Shaw (Captain), Lonn Coward (Waiter), Carrie Keranen (Waitress), Colleen Fitzgerald (Captain), Caroline Matler (Waitress), Brian Petruzzell (Busboy), Lola Belle (Bartender), Susanna Hari (Kitchen staff), Tony Acinapura (Chef), John Charlesworth (Kitchen staff), Laurent Saillard (General manager), Perry Pollaci (Kitchen staff), Matt DiBarro (Bartender) and Tim Donoho (Himself).Only 6.5 million viewers tuned in for the second season premiere, despite launching a week after the finale of the hit first season of The Apprentice. The second season, filmed six months after the restaurant's opening, showed an ongoing power conflict between part owner Rocco DiSpirito and financier Jeffrey Chodorow, stemming from the restaurant's lack of profitability despite its popularity.On July 27, 2004, New York Supreme Court Judge Ira Gammerman issued an injunction barring Rocco DiSpirito from Rocco's on 22nd street and gave Jeffrey Chodorow permission to sell or reopen the restaurant under a new theme. Chodorow and DiSpirito were ordered to return to court on August 31 to determine if there was an agreement between the parties and if DiSpirito violated the agreement. After that ruling DiSpirito attempted to file a $6 million countersuit charging that Chodorow made accounting irregularities and that he (DiSpirito) was owed $175,000 in unpaid salary, and DiSpirito sought to regain fifty percent ownership of the restaurant. Chodorow initially invested $4 million in the restaurant and claims to have lost an additional $700,000.After the restaurant closed its doors on September 15, 2004, it reopened in 2005 as a Brazilian steakhouse called Caviar & Banana. Chodorow's partner in the Brazilian restaurant was chef Claude Troisgros of Roanne, France, renowned for his namesake restaurant in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Caviar & Banana has since closed, along with the subsequent Borough Food & Drink restaurant; the locale continuing to live up to its allegedly \"cursed\" reputation.

He fought on the Eastern Front for three years, earning five medals, including an Iron Cross. Later in the war, he was transferred to the Western Front, where he was captured by the British as the war drew to a close. One of only 90 of his original 1,000-man regiment to survive the war, he was transferred to a prisoner-of-war camp in Ashton-in-Makerfield, Lancashire. Trautmann refused an offer of repatriation, and following his release in 1948, settled in Lancashire, combining farm work with playing goalkeeper for a local football team, St Helens Town.Performances for St Helens gained Trautmann a reputation as an outstanding goalkeeper, resulting in interest from Football League clubs. In October 1949, he signed for Manchester City, a club playing in the country's highest level of football, the First Division. The club's decision to sign a former Axis paratrooper sparked protests and 20,000 people attended a demonstration. Over time, he gained acceptance through his performances in the City goal, playing in all but five of the club's next 250 matches.Named FWA Footballer of the Year for 1956, Trautmann entered football folklore with his performance in the 1956 FA (Football Association) Cup Final. With 17 minutes of the match remaining, Trautmann suffered a serious injury while diving at the feet of  Birmingham City's Peter Murphy. Despite his injury, he continued to play, making crucial saves to preserve his team's 3\u20131 lead. His neck was noticeably crooked as he collected his winner's medal; three days later an X-ray revealed it to be broken.Trautmann played for Manchester City until 1964, making 545 appearances. After his playing career, he moved into management, first with lower-division sides in England and Germany, and later as part of a German Football Association development scheme that took him to several countries, including Burma, Tanzania and Pakistan.

English-language_television_programming 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Port_Charles> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Port Charles (commonly abbreviated as PC) was an American television soap opera which aired on ABC from June 1, 1997 to October 3, 2003. It was a spin-off of the serial General Hospital, which had been running since 1963 and takes place in the fictional city of Port Charles, New York. The new show featured longtime General Hospital characters Lucy Coe, Kevin Collins, Scott Baldwin, and Karen Wexler, along with several new characters, most of whom were interns in a competitive medical school program. In the first episode, tenured nurse Audrey Hardy (General Hospital's longest-running character, portrayed by Rachel Ames) was injured and an intern had to operate on her with a power drill to save her life.In the first few years, Port Charles got a reputation for focusing most of its energies on the medical school program, setting more of its main action at Port Charles' General Hospital than was seen on the parent show, General Hospital. As it evolved, it turned its focus to stories with gothic intrigue that included themes such as forbidden love, vampires, and life after death (somewhat similar to the earlier series Dark Shadows, which also aired on ABC). It also abandoned the basic open-ended writing style used on all other daytime dramas in December 2000, instead creating thirteen-week story arcs (which were also referred to as \"books\"). This type of storytelling is a staple of Latin telenovelas. It also allowed the cast, crew, and writing staff to only work six months out of the year.After Port Charles, the characters of Scott Baldwin and Audrey Hardy returned to General Hospital, and many of the other actors from Port Charles moved on to play roles on other dramas, including a few who took on new roles on General Hospital, such as actors Kelly Monaco, Kiko Ellsworth, Eddie Matos, Kent King, and Jay Pickett. In December 1999, Julie Hanan Carruthers was promoted to executive producer after Wendy Riche wanted to step down to focus on General Hospital.  Carruthers has been the senior supervising producer of Port Charles, while servicing the same role on General Hospital since the inception of Port Charles.Port Charles never attracted strong ratings. Since it taped for only six months out of the year, the remaining episodes were aired with the cast not allowed to return to tape resolutions to storylines. This left the final episode as a cliffhanger; Caleb told Olivia that Alison (Erin Hershey Presley) was pregnant with his baby because of the wish that she (Olivia) made on his ring and it was revealed that Imani was a werewolf.In 2013, the writers of General Hospital revisited the final storyline of Port Charles after actors Michael Easton and Lynn Herring joined the show, putting their own spin on the PC storyline. Easton was now playing John McBain, a role he originated on the cancelled One Life to Live, while Herring would reprise her role as Lucy Coe. To work with the previous PC storyline, Easton started a dual role, playing both John and Caleb onscreen.  At the conclusion of the story arc, it appeared the Caleb character had died; however, in the morgue after Lucy Coe left convinced he was dead, the true Caleb switched bodies with the Medical Examiner and walked out of the morgue."@en .

No surface irregularities of the snow are visible, but a dark object may be clearly seen. There is no visible horizon.\"A whiteout may be due simply to extremely heavy  snowfall rates as seen in lake effect conditions, or to other factors such as diffuse lighting from overcast clouds, mist or fog, or a background of snow. People can be lost in their own front yards during a true whiteout, when the door is only 10 feet (3 meters) away, and they would have to feel their way back. Motorists have to stop their cars where they are, as the road is impossible to see. Normal snowfalls and blizzards, where snow is falling at 1 or 2 inches per hour (2.5 or 5.1 cm/h), or where the relief visibility is not clear yet having a clear field of view for over 30 feet (9 meters), are often incorrectly called whiteouts."@en .

He was also filmed berating the German linesman during the controversial and crippling defeat to the Netherlands in a World Cup qualifier.Taylor returned to club management in March 1994, and achieved more success with Watford. The club was promoted to the Premier League in 1999, after slipping back down the leagues after Taylor's departure 12 years earlier.

Produced by Bob Johnston, the album marked Dylan's return to acoustic music and traditional roots, after three albums of electric rock music. John Wesley Harding shares many stylistic threads with, and was recorded around the same time as, the prolific series of home recording sessions with The Band, partly released in 1975 as The Basement Tapes.John Wesley Harding was exceptionally well received by critics and enjoyed solid sales, reaching #2 on the US charts and topping the UK charts. The commercial performance was considered remarkable considering that Dylan had kept Columbia from releasing the album with much promotion or publicity. Less than three months after its release, John Wesley Harding was certified gold by the RIAA. \"All Along the Watchtower\" became one of his most popular songs after it was recorded by Jimi Hendrix the following year.In 2003, the album was ranked number 301 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time."@en .

He invented a system of notation which was adopted by many microtonal composers after him, including Joseph Maneri.His professional debut (12 note ET music) occurred on a Composers Forum program in New York, 1959. In 1960, compelled by his ear, he began writing microtonal music, and has continued to do so ever since, with the occasional exception being taped music for dancers. His last composition in quarter tones (his sixth microtonal one) was his Third Quartet (1962). Since 1971, whatever music he has composed that is not purely electronic has employed a system of asymmetrical modes of 18 pitches per octave, drawn from a 72-note division of the octave. \"I seem finally to have identified and made transcribable what my ear was after all along: a set of pitches ordered in an asymmetrical scale of 18 (or 19) notes, some of them acoustically more important than others, transposable through a chromatic of 72 pitches in the octave.\" (1978)He has received a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Koussevitsky commission, and an American Academy of Arts & Letters Award, as well as numerous commissions from organizations like the Arizona Friends of Chamber Music and private individuals. He was a co-founder of the Dinosaur Annex Music Ensemble, with Rodney Lister and Scott Wheeler, for which he served as President from 1977\u20131981 and as a member of the Board of Directors from 1981 to 2003.He has lectured on his music in the US and abroad, most notably at the Hamb\u00FCrger Musikgespr\u00E4ch, 1994; the second Naturton Symposium in Heidelberg, 1992; and the 3rd and 4th Symposium, Mikrot\u00F6ne und Ekmelische Musik, at the Hochsch\u00FCle f\u00FCr Musik und Darstellende Kunst Mozarteum, Salzburg, in 1989 & 1991.

With the American cellist Theodore Mook, he designed a font, now widely adopted, for use with computer printing programs, based on his set of accidentals, which are sufficient for 72-note music. His music is published by Frog Peak Music and Diapason Press (Corpus Microtonale).As his award citation from the American Academy of Arts and Letters attests:\"Ezra Sims has already contributed an outstanding body of works, many of which have explored with singular imagination, conviction and success the beautiful but elusive world of microtonal music\""@en .

Articles_containing_video_clips 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Masked_shrike> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "The  masked shrike (Lanius nubicus) is a bird in the shrike family, Laniidae. It breeds in southeastern Europe and at the eastern end of the Mediterranean, with a separate population in eastern Iraq and western Iran, although there are no geographical subspecies. It is migratory, wintering mainly in northeast Africa. Although it is a short-range migrant, vagrants have occurred widely elsewhere, including northern and western Europe. It is the smallest member of its genus, long-tailed and with a hooked bill. The male has mainly black upperparts, with white on its crown, forehead and supercilium and large white patches on the shoulders and wings. The throat, neck sides and underparts are white, with orange flanks and breast. The female is a duller version of the male, with brownish black upperparts and a grey or buff tone to the shoulders and underparts. The juvenile has grey-brown upperparts with a paler forehead and barring from the head to rump, barred off-white underparts and brown wings part from the white primary patches. The species' calls are short and grating, but the song has melodic warbler-like components.The masked shrike's preferred habitat is open woodland with bushes and some large trees. It is less conspicuous than its relatives, avoiding very open country and often perching in less exposed locations. The nest is a neat cup built in a tree by both adults, and the clutch is normally 4\u20136 eggs, which are incubated by the female for 14\u201316 days until hatching. The chicks are fed by both parents until they fledge 18\u201320 days later, and remain dependent on the adults for about 3\u20134 weeks after leaving the nest. The masked shrike eats mainly large insects, occasionally small vertebrates; it sometimes impales its prey on thorns or barbed wire.

Articles_containing_video_clips 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gate_valve> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "A gate valve, also known as a sluice valve, is a valve that opens by lifting a round or rectangular gate/wedge out of the path of the fluid.  The distinct feature of a gate valve is the sealing surfaces between the gate and seats are planar, so gate valves are often used when a straight-line flow of fluid and minimum restriction is desired.  The gate faces can form a wedge shape or they can be parallel. Gate valves are primarily used to permit or prevent the flow of liquids, but typical gate valves shouldn't be used for regulating flow, unless they are specifically designed for that purpose. Because of their ability to cut through liquids, gate valves are often used in the petroleum industry. For extremely thick fluids, a specialty valve often known as a knife valve is used to cut through the liquid.  On opening the gate valve, the flow path is enlarged in a highly nonlinear manner with respect to percent of opening.   This means that flow rate does not change evenly with stem travel. Also, a partially open gate disk tends to vibrate from the fluid flow. Most of the flow change occurs near shutoff with a relatively high fluid velocity causing disk and seat wear and eventual leakage  if  used  to  regulate  flow. Typical gate valves are designed to be fully opened or closed.  When fully open, the typical gate valve has no obstruction in the flow path, resulting in very low friction loss.Gate valves are characterised as having either a rising or a nonrising stem. Rising stems provide a visual indication of valve position because the stem is attached to the gate such that the gate and stem rise and lower together as the valve is operated. Nonrising stem valves may have a pointer threaded onto the upper end of the stem to indicate valve position, since the gate travels up or down the stem on the threads without raising or lowering the stem.  Nonrising stems are used underground or where vertical space is limited.Bonnets provide leakproof closure for the valve body. Gate valves may have a screw-in, union, or bolted bonnet. Screw-in bonnet is the simplest, offering a durable, pressure-tight seal. Union bonnet is suitable for applications requiring frequent inspection and cleaning. It also gives the body added strength. Bolted bonnet is used for larger valves and higher pressure applications.Another type of bonnet construction in a gate valve is pressure seal bonnet. This construction is adopted for valves for high pressure service, typically in excess of 2250 psi (15 MPa). The unique feature about the pressure seal bonnet is that the body - bonnet joints seals improves as the internal pressure in the valve increases, compared to other constructions where the increase in internal pressure tends to create leaks in the body-bonnet joint.Gate valves may have flanged ends which are drilled according to pipeline compatible flange dimensional standards. Gate valves are typically constructed from cast iron, ductile iron, cast carbon steel, gun metal, stainless steel, alloy steels, and forged steels.All-metal gate valves are typically used in  ultra-high vacuum chambers to isolate regions of the chamber."@en .

Francescoli was nicknamed El Pr\u00EDncipe (\"The Prince\" in Spanish) or Le Prince (in French). He played 73 times for the Uruguay national team between 1982 and his retirement in 1997, making him the most capped outfield player in Uruguayan international football at the time. He is regarded as one of the greatest players of Uruguay, perhaps the greatest to have never played for the two biggest clubs in the country. He was known for his classic and elegant style, like El Pr\u00EDncipe, in reference to Hannibal Ciocca, a former Uruguayan player from the 1930s and 40. He later was the only Uruguayan included by Pel\u00E9 in the FIFA 100 list, and was chosen by the International Federation of History and Statistics Football as the sixth greatest player of his country and 24th of South America in the Twentieth Century.He is considered a playmaker in the decadent age of Celeste. He has been in two World Cups, 1986 and 1990, when Uruguay fell in the eighth finals both times (against rival and future champion Argentina and host Italy, respectively), for which he had just arrived, in both cases, as one of the best third-placed in the first phase. When already a veteran, Uruguay failed to qualify for the world cups of 1994 and 1998. Altogether, he played eight matches in the World Cup, winning only one - against the then very inexperienced South Korea, and only 1 - 0.One of his greatest triumphs, while wearing the Celeste jersey, was saving the team in the 1989 Cup Am\u00E9rica. Francescoli played in four of the five games, winning three of those, reaching the final round, losing only to Brazil, whom had home field advantage. They placed second overall, with Francescoli scoring the first and last goal for Celeste.Francescoli admired his rival Argentina, where he felt more appreciated than in his own homeland, where none of his three titles were much celebrated. In neighbouring Argentina, where he now lives, he played for the club River Plate, being one of the biggest fans of the club, whom he played for many years and was the lead scorer and driver for the second (and last) team win in the club's Libertadores Cup, having won a total of five Argentine titles in the six years in which he served for the team. He later enjoyed success with two teams while playing in France, despite the bad results of Racing Paris and its ephemeral passage by another, Olympique de Marseille."@en .

VR Troopers was the first official \"sister series\" to Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. Much like it, this was an Americanization of a Japanese tokusatsu children's program series by Toei. The series is a co-production of Toei Company and Cyberprod.The show featured early CGI and video effects mixed with Japanese stock footage from three different Metal Hero Series: Superhuman Machine Metalder, Dimensional Warrior Spielban and Space Sheriff Shaider. On May 7, 2010 the copyright for VR Troopers was transferred from BVS Entertainment to the SCG Power Rangers group of Saban Capital Group.The series was deemed successful, but not as successful as the Power Rangers franchise. One issue was that the Japanese footage was quickly exhausted due to extreme cases where multiple tokusatsu scenes were put together in one episode to the extent where stock footage had to be reused multiple times throughout the series.

After a lengthy career, and a notable absence from the music charts for several years, he resurrected his career with this album of fifteen cover versions, a new version of one of his own songs (\"Looking Out My Window,\" 1968), and one original track (\"Sexbomb\") recorded as duets with current artists. To ensure that the finished product retained the sound of these artists, he also recorded the tracks in the same studios these artists used, and also used their record producers.Reload became the highest seller of Jones' career, reaching #1 on the British charts in 1999 and again in 2000. Its biggest single was the collaboration with Mousse T, \"Sexbomb\", which reached #3 on the UK Singles Chart, and was later used in an episode of The Simpsons (a show Jones had guest starred on in 1992). The album has sold more than six million copies worldwide. The album was not released immediately in the US with Jones's US record company stating that many of the artists were not known outside of the UK.

English-language_albums 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Impossible_Princess> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Impossible Princess is the sixth studio album by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue, released on 1 November 1997 by Deconstruction Records. Minogue started working on the new album when travelling with then-boyfriend St\u00E9phane Sednaoui to various countries. Following the sessions with Dave Ball, Ingo Vauk, Brothers in Rhythm, Manic Street Preachers and Rob Dougan, Deconstruction's A&R department had not been present for much of the recording due to Hadfield's poor health. This left Minogue with partial creative control over the project. The album took over two years to finish, making it her longest project ever penned by Minogue since her success as Charlene Mitchell in TV soap opera Neighbours.Musically, the album is a pop and dance album with strong elements of trip-hop music within its composition, finding influences in techno, drum and bass, indie rock and folk and, making it a departure from her previous work. Minogue contributed to all the lyrics and composition of the album. While on her travels, she begun writing songs in different locations away from her home in Chelsea, London, exploring the themes and meaning of the sentences. There are many themes associated with the album, as a result of her exploration of her celebrity status, self-identification as an artist, her relationship with Sednaoui and her feelings towards her life at that point.Upon release, the album received mixed to positive reviews. Some critics complimented its fluent nature, while others criticized her attempt for credibility and felt the image projected towards the album was fraud-like. Impossible Princess was a success in Minogue's native Australia, where it reached number four on the Australian Albums Chart and number one on the Australian Music Report chart in January 1998, and was certified Platinum. In the United Kingdom, however, it was a commercial disappointment, peaking just inside the top ten. The album was retitled Kylie Minogue in the UK following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in August 1997. Four singles were released from the album, which fared well critically but lacked chart progression.The album was supported by the Intimate and Live concert tour, which was critically acclaimed. Critics alike had considered the album to be an example of Minogue's constant \"reinventions\". Dubbing her as \"Indie Kylie\", it has been recognized as one of Minogue's greatest triumphs and had been recognized as a big step forward in terms of her musical composition. The album was recognized for its critical comparison of Madonna's Ray of Light (1998), which was released at a similar time. A remastered edition of Impossible Princess with title reinstated, was issued by BMG in 2003 with a bonus disc of remixes and B-sides. The album has received retrospective acclaim from critics and recognition, calling it one of the most underrated albums in pop history."@en .

He was professor of history at York University for 25 years until 1996. Through his championing of so-called \"limited identities\", Cook contributed to the rise of the New Social History, which uses \"class, gender and ethnicity\" as its three main categories of analysis. Cook's conception of \"limited identities\" was famously formulated in an article in the International Journal in 1967, Canada's centenary year, reviewing the state of contemporary scholarship on Canadian nationalism:After six new books on the great Canadian problem \u2014 our lack of unity and identity \u2014 are we getting any nearer the source of the problem? Undoubtedly something is achieved: if nothing else one can wonder if the search is worth the effort. Certainly we should continue to try to understand ourselves; an unexamined nation is not worth living in. But it may be that the frame of reference is wrong. Perhaps instead of constantly deploring our lack of identity, we should attempt to understand and explain the regional, ethnic and class identities that we do have. It might just be that it is in these limited identities that \"Canadianism\" is found, and that except for our over-heated nationalist intellectuals, Canadians find this situation quite satisfactory.During his teaching career, Cook supervised the work of many prominent social historians such as Franca Iacovetta.In 1997, the Ramsay Cook Research Scholarship was established at York University to honour his contribution to the field of history.He publicly supported Pierre Elliott Trudeau in his attempt to gain the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada in 1968.He is married to Eleanor Cook, an English professor at the University of Toronto"@en .

Initially released in Japan in August 2000 by Game Arts, the game was later made available in English for North America the following December, and in Europe in February 2001, with both releases published by Ubisoft. The game was later ported to the Sony PlayStation 2, where it was released worldwide throughout 2002, and later for Microsoft Windows exclusively in North America and Europe later that year. It was developed by many of the same staff members who worked on the original Grandia, including music composer Noriyuki Iwadare but was designed around the idea of creating a more \"mature\" product than the previous title, as well as the first in the series to feature fully three-dimensional graphics.The game is set in a fantasy world thousands of years after a battle between Granas, the god of light, and Valmar, the god of darkness, nearly destroyed the planet until Valmar was split into pieces and scattered across the land. In the aftermath of the battle, the Church of Granas has led humanity to prosperity by spreading the word of good, but when a young mercenary named Ryudo is charged to protect a songstress from the church named Elena, their journey reveals that the church's history, as well as the history of the world, is not all it seems.While the original Dreamcast version of the game received a largely positive response from critics in Japan and the West, its later ports to the PlayStation 2 and PC were typically seen as inferior due to a combination of technical shortcomings and other high-profile games released during the transition."@en .

Loosely based on the German fairy tale \"Rapunzel\" in the collection of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm, it is the 50th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. Featuring the voices of Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi, and Donna Murphy, the film tells the story of a lost young princess with long magical hair who yearns to leave her secluded tower. Against her mother's wishes, she accepts the aid of a handsome intruder to take her out into the world which she has never seen.Before the film's release, its title was changed from Rapunzel to Tangled, reportedly to market the film as gender-neutral. Tangled spent six years in production at a cost that has been estimated at $260 million, which, if accurate, would make it the most expensive animated film ever made and the fourth most-expensive film of all time.

In the United States, these cadences are sometimes called jody calls or jodies, after Jody, a recurring character who figures in some traditional cadences.Requiring no instruments to play, they are counterparts in oral military folklore of the military march. As a sort of work song, military cadences take their rhythms from the work being done (compare sea shanty). Many cadences have a call and response structure of which one soldier initiates a line, and the remaining soldiers complete it, thus instilling teamwork and camaraderie for completion. The cadence calls move to the beat and rhythm of the normal speed (quick time) march or running-in-formation (double time) march. This serves the purpose of keeping soldiers \"dressed\", moving in step as a unit and in formation, while maintaining the correct beat or cadence.The word \"cadence\" was applied to these work songs because of an earlier meaning, in which it meant the number of steps a marcher or runner took per minute. The cadence was set by a drummer or sergeant and discipline was extremely important, as keeping the cadence directly affected the travel speed of infantry. There were other purposes: the close-order drill was a particular cadence count for the complex sequence of loading and firing a musket. In the Revolutionary War, Baron von Steuben notably imported European battlefield techniques which persist, greatly modified, to this day."@en .

Mother Millett and The Loony Bin Trip, for instance, dealt with family issues and the times when she was involuntarily committed. Besides appearing in a number of documentaries, she produced Three Lives and wrote Not a Love Story: A Film About Pornography.

Since 1986 he served as Professor of Political Theory at the University of Essex, where he founded and directed for many years the graduate programme in Ideology and Discourse Analysis, as well as the Centre for Theoretical Studies in the Humanities and the Social Sciences. Under his directorship, the Ideology and Discourse Analysis programme has provided the suitable research framework for the development of a distinct type of discourse analysis that draws on post-structuralist theory (especially the work of Lacan, Foucault, Derrida, and Barthes) in order to articulate innovative analyses of concrete political phenomena (identities, discourses and hegemonies). This theoretical and analytical orientation is today known as the 'Essex School of discourse analysis'.Over the years, Laclau lectured extensively in many universities in North America, South America, Western Europe, Australia, and South Africa. Most recently he has held positions at SUNY Buffalo and Northwestern University, both in the US.His long-term partner was Chantal Mouffe.  He died, of a heart attack, in Seville in 2014."@en .

Two days later, on May 11, 2001, Adams died of a heart attack in Santa Barbara, California.

By accident on the same day the naming of minor planet (18610) Arthurdent was announced by the Minor Planet Center. We wanted to make Mr. Adams a joy, but did never dare to think that he wouldn't be able to receive this surprise, when we sent our name proposal to the MPC a few months back.The naming citation reads:(18610) Arthurdent = 1998 CC2Discovered 1998 Feb. 7 at Starkenburg Observatory.The earthling Arthur Dent is confronted with the adversities of life, the universe and everything in a highly amusing and entertaining way in Douglas Adam's famous five-volume trilogy The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy."@en .

The story was made into a motion picture by Paramount Pictures.  The Bridges at Toko-Ri closely follows the novel, emphasizing the lives of the pilots and crew in the context of a war that seems remote to all except those who fight in it. The film stars William Holden, Grace Kelly, Fredric March, Mickey Rooney, and  Robert Strauss, and it also contains early film roles by Dennis Weaver and Earl Holliman.Michener based his novel on actual missions flown against the railroad bridges at Majon-ni and Samdong-ni, North Korea, during the winter of 1951\u201352, when he was a news correspondent aboard the aircraft carriers USS Essex and USS Oriskany.The pilot's rescue attempt at the climax of the novel and film was a composite of a pair of unrelated rescue attempts on February 8, 1952, both in the area of Wonsan, North Korea, with the second one involving a propeller-driven Douglas A-1 Skyraider from the Valley Forge that had been shot down while bombing the railroad bridges at Samdong-ni. However, though the shot-down aviators in the second attempt were initially listed as missing in action, they survived their ordeal, and they were captured by North Korean soldiers.In the attacks against the historical bridges, the McDonnell F2H Banshee  fighter-bombers (represented by Grumman F9F Panther) that are at the heart of the story did not bomb the bridges themselves, since they did not have the capability of carrying the heavy aerial bombs that were needed. Instead, they carried out the perilous mission of suppressing enemy anti-aircraft fire."@en .

Articles_containing_video_clips 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pole_star> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "A pole star is a visible star, preferably a prominent one, that is approximately aligned with the Earth's axis of rotation; that is, a star whose apparent position is close to one of the celestial poles, and which lies approximately directly overhead when viewed from the Earth's North Pole or South Pole. A similar concept also applies to other planets than the Earth. In practice, the term pole star usually refers to Polaris, which is the current northern pole star, also known as the North Star.The south celestial pole currently lacks a bright star like Polaris to mark its position. At present, the naked-eye star nearest to this imaginary point is the faint Sigma Octantis, which is sometimes known as the South Star.While other stars' apparent positions in the sky change throughout the night, as they appear to rotate around the celestial poles, pole stars' apparent positions remain virtually fixed. This makes them especially useful in celestial navigation: they are a dependable indicator of the direction toward the respective geographic pole although not exact; they are virtually fixed, and their angle of elevation can also be used to determine latitude.The identity of the pole stars gradually changes over time because the celestial poles exhibit a slow continuous drift through the star field. The primary reason for this is the precession of the Earth's rotational axis, which causes its orientation to change over time. If the stars were fixed in space, precession would cause the celestial poles to trace out imaginary circles on the celestial sphere approximately once every 26,000 years, passing close to different stars at different times. The stars themselves also exhibit proper motion, which causes a very small additional apparent drift of pole stars."@en .

He debuted for Collingwood in 1920, and was joined by his brother, Syd Coventry, at the club two years later. Playing almost exclusively at full-forward, Coventry first led Collingwood's goalkicking in 1922, and would go on to lead the club's goalkicking for 16 consecutive seasons, until his retirement in 1937. He also led the VFL's goalkicking on six occasions: each year from 1926 to 1930, and then again in his final season. In 1929, Coventry kicked 124 goals for the season, becoming the first player in the league to kick over 100 goals in a season, a feat which he would replicate in 1930, 1933, and 1934. Considered the leading forward in the competition in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Coventry played a key part in Collingwood's four consecutive premierships from 1927 to 1930, each captained by his brother. He also went on to win the Copeland Trophy as Collingwood's best and fairest player in 1933. At his retirement at the end of the 1937 season, Coventry held the records for the most career games played and the most career goals kicked, finishing with 1299 goals from 306 games, and thus also becoming the first player to play 300 games. An inaugural inductee into the Australian Football Hall of Fame, and a member of Collingwood's Team of the Century, his career goalkicking record was not broken until 1999, when it was surpassed by Tony Lockett."@en .

He studied medicine at Edinburgh University, and became a surgeon in the navy in 1807. He traveled with John Franklin in search of the Northwest Passage on the Coppermine Expedition of 1819\u20131822. Richardson wrote the sections on geology, botany and icthyology for the official account of the expedition.Franklin and Richardson returned to Canada in 1825 and went overland by fur trade routes to the mouth of the Mackenzie River. Franklin was to go as far west as possible and Richardson was to go east to the mouth of the Coppermine River.  These were the only known points on the central coast and had been reached in 1793 and 1771 respectively. He had with him two specially-built boats which were more ocean-worthy than the voyageur canoes used by Franklin on his previous expedition. They gave their names to the Dolphin and Union Strait near the end of his route. His journey was successful and he reached his furthest east the same day that Franklin reached his furthest west (16 August 1826). He abandoned his boats at Bloody Falls and trekked overland to Fort Franklin which he reached three weeks before Franklin. Together they had surveyed 1,878 miles of previously unmapped coast. The natural history discoveries of this expedition were so great that they had to be recorded in two separate works, the Flora Boreali-Americana (1833\u201340), written by William Jackson Hooker, and the Fauna Boreali-Americana (1829\u201337), written by Richardson, William John Swainson, John Edward Gray and William Kirby.At the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in 1842, Richardson described the diving apparatus and treatment of diver Roderick Cameron following an injury that occurred on 14 October 1841 during the salvage operations on the HMS Royal George.Richardson was knighted in 1846. He traveled with John Rae on an unsuccessful search for Franklin in 1848\u201349, describing it in An Arctic Searching Expedition (1851). He retired to the Lake District in 1855, and is buried at St Oswald's Church, Grasmere.He also wrote accounts dealing with the natural history, and especially the ichthyology, of several other Arctic voyages, and was the author of Icones Piscium (1843), Catalogue of Apodal Fish in the British Museum (1856), the second edition of Yarrell's History of British Fishes (1860), The Polar Regions (1861). and Arctic Ordeal: The Journal of John Richardson Edited by C.

The show ran in the UK on ITV2 and was repeated later in the week on ITV1, and now airs on ITV4.  It also aired on AXN in India, and on the Spanish language network Telemundo.  The second season, featuring welterweight contenders, premiered in the U.S. on Tuesday, July 18, 2006, at 10 pm ET/PT, on ESPN.  The third season, featuring super middleweight contenders, premiered in the U.S. on Tuesday, September 4, 2007, at 10 pm ET/PT, on ESPN.

Before the show premiered, rival US television Fox network rushed to air a competing show The Next Great Champ, hosted by Oscar de la Hoya. The show performed very poorly, with the final episodes being relegated to cable FSN. In an effort to distance itself from the Fox disaster, NBC opted to hold airing its show until spring 2005.The show takes the format of a gameshow, with the boxers divided into two teams based on their place of residence in the United States: East Coast or West Coast (or simply \u201CEast\u201D and \u201CWest\u201D). These teams live together in group living quarters, in Pasadena, California in the historic Royal Laundry Building on Raymond Avenue, and compete for the right to choose which of their team members fights that week, and who he fights against. Most of the second half of the hour-long episodes are devoted to that fight: the loser is eliminated.On February 14, 2005, one of the 16 contestants, Najai Turpin, despondent over personal matters, committed suicide, shooting himself while sitting with his girlfriend in a parked car outside the West Philadelphia gym where he trained. In his memory, the producers set up a trust fund for his daughter Anyae. The show still aired in its entirety, but with a special tribute to Turpin.On May 16, 2005, the series was cancelled. The first season cost NBC $2,000,000 per episode. Reruns were seen on CNBC. On August 11, 2005, ESPN announced that it was picking up the rights to a second season of the show, which began airing on the network in July 2006, although special editions under the Contender title are currently airing as of March, 2006.

After appearing at the Hollywood Bowl in 1947, Lanza signed a seven-year film contract with Louis B. Mayer, the head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer who saw his performance and was impressed by his singing. Prior to this, the adult Lanza had sung only two performances of an opera. The following year (1948), however, he would sing the role of Pinkerton in Puccini's Madama Butterfly in New Orleans.His movie debut was in That Midnight Kiss (1949) with Kathryn Grayson and Ethel Barrymore. The following year, in The Toast of New Orleans, his featured popular song \"Be My Love\" became his first million-selling hit. In 1951, he played the role of Enrico Caruso (1873\u20131921), his tenor idol, in the biopic, The Great Caruso, which produced another million-seller with \"The Loveliest Night of the Year\" (a song which used the melody of Sobre las Olas). The Great Caruso was the top-grossing film that year.The title song of his next film, Because You're Mine, was his final million-selling hit song. The song went on to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. After recording the soundtrack for his next film, The Student Prince, he embarked upon a protracted battle with Studio Head Dore Schary arising from artistic differences with director Curtis Bernhardt, and was eventually dismissed by MGM.Lanza was known to be \"rebellious, tough, and ambitious\", and during most of his film career, he suffered from addictions to overeating and alcohol which had a serious effect on his health and his relationships with directors, producers and, occasionally, other cast members. Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper writes that \"his smile, which was as big as his voice, was matched with the habits of a tiger cub, impossible to housebreak\". She adds that he was the \"last of the great romantic performers\". He made three more films before dying of an apparent pulmonary embolism at the age of 38. At the time of his death in 1959 he was still \"the most famous tenor in the world\". Author Eleonora Kimmel concludes that Lanza \"blazed like a meteor whose light lasts a brief moment in time\"."@en .

He served two terms as Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, acting as Governor for the remainder of Governor James Sullivan's term after his death in December 1808. Lincoln was unsuccessful in his bid to be elected governor in his own right in 1809.Born in Hingham, Massachusetts, Lincoln was educated at Harvard, and studied law with Joseph Hawley before establishing a law practice in Worcester, Massachusetts. He was active in local politics, and participated in the convention that drafted the Massachusetts Constitution in 1779. He supported Quock Walker, a former slave seeking confirmation of his freedom under that constitution in 1783. He entered national politics with his election to the United States House of Representatives in 1800, but was immediately tapped by Jefferson to become Attorney General. Lincoln served Jefferson as a consultant on the politics of New England, and was influential in the distribution of patronage in the region. He served on a commission that resolved claims emanating from the Yazoo land scandal in Georgia, and advised Jefferson on matters related to the Louisiana Purchase.He returned to Massachusetts, where he remained politically active in the state. He established Republican dominance in Worcester, even though the state was dominated by Federalists. He was elected lieutenant governor under James Sullivan in 1807, but failed to win election in his own right in 1809 in a highly partisan election. He retired from politics in 1811, declining nomination to the Supreme Court because of his health. His descendants were a major influence in Worcester for much of the 19th century."@en .

Endara later received a law degree in Panama. He subsequently served as a member of Panama's National Assembly, and briefly as a government minister before heading into exile again following Arias' third overthrow. After Arias' death in 1988, Endara became a leading opponent of the Manuel Noriega military dictatorship, heading the opposition coalition in the 1989 presidential election. Though his coalition was judged by international observers as having defeated pro-Noriega candidate Carlos Duque, the results were annulled by the government, and Endara and his running mates were attacked in the streets by the paramilitary Dignity Battalions. The assaults received widespread coverage in international media, helping to build support within the U.S. for military action against Noriega. Seven months later, the United States invaded Panama, and swore in Endara as the new president on the first night of the invasion on a U.S. military base.During his presidency, Endara abolished the Panamanian military and replaced it with a national police force. Endara's term saw steady economic growth and a return of democratic institutions, but also high unemployment rates.

Although it comprises all genres of \"popular music\" within South Korea, the term is more often used in a narrower sense to describe a modern form of South Korean pop music covering: dance-pop, pop ballad, electronic, rock, metal, hip-hop music and R&B.In 1992, modern K-pop was ushered in with the formation of Seo Taiji & Boys, whose successful experimentation with different music styles had sparked a paradigm shift in the music industry of South Korea. As a result, the integration of foreign musical elements has now become a common practice in the K-pop industry.As Korean pop culture is becoming a increasingly globalized phenomenon and globally popular in many parts of the world allows South Korea to utilize its pop cultural sector to access, tap and break into foreign entertainment markets. By tapping into social networking services and the video sharing platform YouTube, the K-pop industry's ability to secure a sizable overseas audience has facilitated a noticeable rise in the global proliferation of the genre. Since the mid-2000s, the K-pop music market has experienced double digit growth rates. In the first half of 2012, it grossed nearly US$3.4 billion and was recognized by Time magazine as \"South Korea's Greatest Export\".First gaining popularity in East Asia in the late 1990s, K-pop entered the Japanese music market towards the turn of the 21st century. In the late 2000s, it grew from a musical genre into a subculture among teenagers and young adults of East and Southeast Asia. Currently, the spread of K-pop to other regions of the world, via the Korean Wave, is seen in parts of Latin America, Northeast India, North Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and immigrant enclaves of the Western world."@en .

They possess exceptional dung disposal capacity and one dung beetle can bury dung that is 250 times heavier than itself in one night.Many dung beetles, known as rollers, roll dung into round balls, which are used as a food source or brooding chambers. Other dung beetles, known as tunnelers, bury the dung wherever they find it. A third group, the dwellers, neither roll nor burrow: they simply live in manure. They are often attracted by the dung collected by burrowing owls. Dung Beetles can grow to 3 cm long and 2 cm wide.All the species belong to the superfamily Scarabaeoidea; most of them to the subfamilies Scarabaeinae and Aphodiinae of the family Scarabaeidae (scarab beetles). As most species of Scarabaeinae feed exclusively on feces, that subfamily is often dubbed true dung beetles. There are dung-feeding beetles which belong to other families, such as the Geotrupidae (the earth-boring dung beetle). The Scarabaeinae alone comprises more than 5,000 species.Dung beetles are currently the only known insect to navigate and orient themselves using the Milky Way."@en .

This wide separation relative to the pair's size is rather unusual and it is believed that both Esclangona and its moon are ejecta from an asteroidal collision in the past that left the scene as a co-orbiting pair; a similar pairing is 3749 Balam and its moon."@en .

British_films 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scum_(film)> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Scum is a 1979 British crime drama film directed by Alan Clarke, portraying the brutality of life inside a British borstal. The script was originally made for the BBC's Play for Today strand in 1977, however due to the violence depicted, it was withdrawn from broadcast. Two years later, director Alan Clarke and scriptwriter Roy Minton remade it as a film, first shown on Channel 4 in 1983. By this time the borstal system had been reformed and eventually allowed the original TV version to be aired.The film tells the story of a young offender named Carlin as he arrives at the institution and his rise through violence and self-protection to the top of the inmates' pecking order, purely as a tool to survive. Beyond Carlin's individual storyline, it is also cast as an indictment of the borstal system's flaws with no attempt at rehabilitation. The warders and convicts alike are brutalised by the system. The film's controversy was derived from its graphic depiction of racism, extreme violence, rape, suicide, many fights and very strong language.Scum would be one of the most controversial British films of the early 1980s, but has since become regarded as a popular classic."@en .

During his time at Ohio State, Hunter was initiated into the Theta Delta chapter of the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity.  After graduation, he held a number of jobs and joined the U.S. Army in 1940. After rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel, he became the assistant chief of staff of the Caribbean Defense Command. He was later awarded the Legion of Merit. After World War II, he served as the business manager for the North Carolina Symphony.In 1947, Hunter decided to pursue graduate studies in the Department of Dramatic Arts at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. While enrolled, three of Hunter's plays were produced by the Carolina Playmakers, a dramatic group at the University. When the Cherokee Historical Association began looking for a playwright to write an outdoor drama to be performed in Cherokee, North Carolina, Hunter won the commission and wrote his most famous play Unto These Hills. The play opened July 1, 1950 and still plays on at the Mountainside Theatre.  He also wrote the play for the Cherokee Nation based in Tahlequah, OK, The Trail of Tears.  This play was performed each summer at the Cherokee Heritage Center located south of Tahlequah until the mid-90's.After receiving his masters, Hunter remained in Chapel Hill to pursue his Ph.D..

Windows_games 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ground_Control_(video_game)> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Ground Control is a 2000 real-time tactics video game developed by Massive Entertainment. It features 3D graphics and a free-floating camera which allows one to zoom in and out and view the action from any angle, from a bird's-eye view to the perspective of one's own assault units at ground level. As a real-time tactics game, Ground Control completely does away with resource and economic management. One must therefore focus all attention on controlling a limited set of units to achieve victory.Units in the game include various types of tanks, hovercraft, aircraft, and infantry, and are delivered to the battlefield by orbital dropships. However, once in battle, the player is not able to summon reinforcements, so proper troop selection between levels is a key to success. Each unit type has special weapons, abilities, and armor. Players can choose to customize each unit or let the game auto-select the load-out for each mission. The units of the two factions in the game differ in several areas: the Crayven Corporation has hardier units that rely on traditional ballistics and movement. The Order of the New Dawn's units trade heavy armor for a hover propulsion system that grants them increased speed and mobility, and use energy weaponry that give them more damage potential."@en .

Articles_containing_video_clips 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Transit_of_Venus> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "A transit of Venus across the Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes directly between the Sun and Earth (or another planet), becoming visible against (and hence obscuring a small portion of) the solar disk. During a transit, Venus can be seen from Earth as a small black disk moving across the face of the Sun. The duration of such transits is usually measured in hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes). A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of Venus is more than 3 times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more slowly across the face of the Sun, because it is much farther away from Earth.Transits of Venus are among the rarest of predictable astronomical phenomena. They occur in a pattern that generally repeats every 243 years, with pairs of transits eight years apart separated by long gaps of 121.5 years and 105.5 years. The periodicity is a reflection of the fact that the orbital periods of Earth and Venus are close to 8:13 and 243:395 commensurabilities.The last transit of Venus was on 5 and 6 June 2012, and was the last Venus transit of the 21st century; the prior transit took place on 8 June 2004. The previous pair of transits were in December 1874 and December 1882. The next transits of Venus will be 10\u201311 December 2117, and 8 December 2125.Venus transits are historically of great scientific importance as they were used to gain the first realistic estimates of the size of the Solar System. Observations of the 1639 transit, combined with the principle of parallax, provided an estimate of the distance between the Sun and the Earth that was more accurate than any other up to that time. The 2012 transit provided scientists with a number of other research opportunities, particularly in the refinement of techniques to be used in the search for exoplanets."@en .
American_military_personnel_of_World_War_II 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elbert_Tuttle> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Elbert Parr Tuttle (July 17, 1897 \u2013 June 23, 1996), one of the \"Fifth Circuit Four\", and a liberal Republican from Georgia, was chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit from 1960 to 1967, when that court became known for a series of decisions crucial in advancing the civil rights of African-Americans. At that time, the Fifth Circuit included not only Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas (its jurisdiction as of 2012), but also Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and the Panama Canal Zone.Tuttle was born in Pasadena, California. In 1906, his family moved to Hawaii where he attended Punahou School. In October 1910, he and his brother Malcolm built and flew the first glider in Hawaii. Tuttle then attended Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, from which he graduated in 1918. He then fought in World War I in the United States Army Air Service from 1918 to 1919. Tuttle was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity and the Sphinx Head Society.Tuttle received an LL.B. from Cornell Law School in 1923.  He was a reporter for the New York Evening World for several years while attending law school. After graduating from law school, he moved to the capital city of Atlanta, Georgia, to practice law with the law firm of Sutherland, Tuttle & Brennan from 1923 to 1953. (The firm is today named Sutherland Asbill & Brennan.)Tuttle mainly worked on tax litigation, but also did pro bono work and worked with the American Civil Liberties Union, including doing numerous civil rights cases.Tuttle served as a Colonel in the United States Army from 1941 to 1946, in World War II, declining a desk job.  He was severely injured after engaging in hand to hand combat in Okinawa on the island of Ie Shima.  He was awarded numerous medals for his service including the Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, and the Bronze Service Arrowhead.  Tuttle retired as a Brigadier General and was often called \"The General\" by those who worked closely with him.After the War, Tuttle became more involved in politics, working with the Republican Party because of his opposition to segregation, which he associated mostly with southern Democrats. He was a general counsel for the United States Department of the Treasury from 1953 to 1954.  He was nominated on July 7, 1954, by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower to a new Fifth Circuit seat created by 68 Stat. 871; he was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 3, 1954, and received commission the next day. Tuttle served as chief judge for seven years, then assumed senior status.In the aftermath of the disputed 1966 Georgia gubernatorial election between Democrat Lester Maddox and Republican Howard \"Bo\" Callaway, Tuttle joined Democratic Judge Griffin Bell, later the United States Attorney General, in striking down the Georgia constitutional provision requiring that the legislature chose the governor if no general election candidate receives a majority of the vote. The judges concluded that a malapportioned legislature might \"dilute\" the votes of the candidate with a plurality, in this case Callaway. Bell compared legislative selection to the former County Unit System, a kind of electoral college formerly used in Georgia to select the governor but invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court. Bell and Tuttle granted a temporary suspension of their ruling to permit appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court and stipulated that the state could resolve the deadlock so long as the legislature not make the selection. In a five-to-two decision known as Fortson v. Morris, the high court struck down the Bell-Tuttle legal reasoning and directed the legislature to choose between Maddox and Callaway. Two liberal justices, William O. Douglas and Abe Fortas, had argued against legislative selection of the governor, but the court majority, led this time by Hugo Black took the strict constructionist line and cleared the path for Maddox's ultimate election.On October 1, 1981, Tuttle was transferred to the new Eleventh Circuit, and continued to serve as a senior judge until his death on June 23, 1996.  The Elbert P. Tuttle U.S. Court of Appeals Building was named in his honor in 1989.For his work in civil rights cases in the South, Tuttle received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1981. He has a star on Atlanta's International Civil Rights Walk of Fame."@en .

The theory behind this is that more and better information and communication furthers the development of a society.Aside from its reliance on technology, ICT4D also requires an understanding of community development, poverty, agriculture, healthcare, and basic education. This makes ICT4D appropriate technology and if it is shared openly open source appropriate technology. Richard Heeks suggests that the I in ICT4D is related with \u201Clibrary and information sciences\u201D, the C is associated with \u201Ccommunication studies\", the T is linked with \u201Cinformation systems\", and the D for \u201Cdevelopment studies\u201D. It is aimed at bridging the digital divide and aid economic development by fostering equitable access to modern communications technologies. It is a powerful tool for economic and social development. Other terms can also be used for \"ICT4D\" or \"ICT4Dev\" (\"ICT for development\") like ICTD (\"ICT and development\", which is used in a broader sense) and development informatics.ICT4D can refer to assisting disadvantaged populations anywhere in the world, but it is usually associated with applications in developing countries. It is concerned with directly applying information technology approaches to poverty reduction. ICTs can be applied directly, wherein its use directly benefits the disadvantaged population, or indirectly, wherein it can assist aid organisations or non-governmental organizations or governments or businesses to improve socio-economic conditions.The field is an interdisciplinary research area through the growing number of conferences, workshops and publications. This is partly due to the need for scientifically validated benchmarks and results, that can measure the effectiveness of current projects. This field has also produced an informal community of technical and social science researchers who rose out of the annual ICT4D conferences."@en .

He was born in Pictou, Nova Scotia, the eldest son of Sir John William Dawson, Principal of McGill University and his wife, Lady Margaret Dawson. By age 11, he was afflicted with tuberculosis of the spine (Pott's disease) that resulted in a deformed back and stunted his growth. However, his physical limitations did not deter Dawson from becoming one of Canada's greatest scientists.Tutors and his father provided his educational needs during his slow recovery from the illness. Dawson later attended the High School of Montreal and McGill University (part-time) before moving to London to study geology and paleontology at the Royal School of Mines (now part of Imperial College London) beginning in 1869. Dawson graduated after three years with the highest marks in his class. Dawson received an LL.D. from Queen's University in 1890 and then from McGill University in 1891.Dawson began his career in the 1870s as a professor of chemistry at Morrin College in Quebec City. He then performed extensive surveys of Western Canada in the 19th century beginning with the International Boundary Survey from 1872 to 1876. The result was a 387-page report called Geology and Resources of the Region in the Vicinity of the 49th parallel from the Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains, with Lists of Plants and Animals Collected, and Notes on the Fossils from the Killadeer Badlands currently part of Grasslands National Park. This report established Dawson as a respected scientist.During 1883 and 1884, Dawson travelled through the Canadian Rockies where he was tasked by the Canadian government to map out major mountains and mountain passes as well as significant rivers. Some of the many peaks he discovered were Mount Assiniboine 3,618 metres (11,870 ft) and Mount Temple 3,543 metres (11,624 ft). As a result of his field research, a map of his work was published in 1886 covering the Canadian Rockies from the US border to Red Deer Valley and Kicking Horse Pass.In 1887, he led an expedition into the Yukon, developing some of the first maps of what later became the separate territory. His report was republished ten years later to satisfy the public's interest in the region as a result of the Klondike Gold Rush. Dawson City was named after him. Dawson Creek, British Columbia is also named in his honour.Dawson became a staff member of the Geological Survey of Canada in 1875, progressed to assistant director in 1883 and finally to director in 1895.In 1891, Dawson was named a fellow of the Royal Society of London. In 1892, he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.Dawson died unexpectedly in Ottawa  in March, 1901, after a one day bout with acute bronchitis. He was interred in the family plot in the Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal."@en .

His parents were Maurice G. and Leah Feingold.He earned a Ph.D, with thesis advisor Donald H. Menzel, from Harvard University in 1937, having started there at age 16.  Before leaving Harvard, Greenstein was involved in a project with Fred Lawrence Whipple to explain Karl Jansky's discovery of radio waves from the Milky Way and to propose a source.  He began his professional career at Yerkes Observatory under Otto Struve and later went to Caltech.  With Louis G. Henyey he invented a new spectrograph and a wide-field camera.  He directed the Caltech astronomy program until 1972 and later did classified work on military reconnaissance satellites.With Leverett Davis, Jr, he demonstrated in 1949 that the magnetic field in our galaxy is aligned with the spiral arms. His theoretical work with Davis was based on the conclusion just reached by William A. Hiltner that the recently detected polarization of starlight was due to scattering off interstellar dust grains aligned by a magnetic field.Greenstein did important work in determining the abundances of the elements in stars, and was, with Maarten Schmidt, among the first to recognize quasars as compact, very distant sources as bright as a galaxy. The spectra of the first quasars discovered, radio sources 3C 48 and 3C 273, were displaced so far to the red due to their redshifts as to be almost unrecognizable, but Greenstein deciphered 3C 48 shortly before Schmidt, his colleague at the Hale Observatories worked out the spectrum of 3C 273."@en .

Windows_games 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Elder_Scrolls_III:_Tribunal> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal is the first expansion for Bethesda Game Studios' The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. It takes place in the temple/city of Mournhold, the capital of Morrowind, located in the larger city of Almalexia. The title refers to the three \"Living Gods\", known as the Tribunal.Instead of directly modifying the original game world, the city of Mournhold is only accessible by teleportation. While the city of Mournhold appears to be similar to the open-air towns of the original game, Mournhold is actually akin to an interior room. Players cannot levitate while in Mournhold, because levitation would reveal that the \"sky\" of Mournhold is little more than a ceiling (although the game states it is forbidden so not to offend Almalexia). Should a player go over the walls of Mournhold (using spells or scrolls such as Scroll of Icarian Flight) they will find the area of Mournhold they were in floating in an endless ocean. The other districts of Mournhold will be absent from the ocean. This was probably done because the original game included only the islands of Vvardenfell, and Mournhold, in the fictional geography of Tamriel, lies on the mainland and a considerable distance inland.The most notable aspect of Tribunal is the modification of Morrowind's journal system. In the original game, a player's journal can become extremely lengthy and cumbersome. Tribunal allows a player to sort their journal by quest (instead of chronologically sorted) in order to determine what is required for a specific quest.  Another notable feature of the expansion is the Museum of Artifacts.  The owner of the museum will pay the player half of the value of an artifact (up to 30,000 gold) for one of the very rare artifacts of Morrowind.  This is more than the player can get for the artifact at any other store.  The museum starts with one artifact (Stendarr's Hammer), and puts the new artifacts on display cases as they are sold to the museum."@en .

While it was originally released as an expansion set for Microsoft Windows, Bloodmoon is included within the Morrowind: Game of the Year edition for Xbox.Unlike the first expansion Tribunal, which added a city separate from the world map consisting of interior cells, Bloodmoon adds a large new island to the original world map, a cold northern territory named Solstheim. Rather than the Dunmer (dark elves) that are the indigenous race in the nearby Vvardenfell, Solstheim is populated largely by the Nord race. This is largely because the island sits more or less astride the border between Morrowind and the Nord homeland of Skyrim.This expansion adds new enemies, the East Empire Company as a joinable guild, and the possibility to become a werewolf, akin to the inclusion of vampires seen in Morrowind. Bloodmoon also uses larger and more detailed environments, including snowfall, thus raising the computer hardware requirements, though the ash storms of the original game are much more graphically demanding than the snow of Bloodmoon.As with Morrowind and Tribunal, Bloodmoon has many side-quests to finish and many caves to explore aside from its main quest. Unlike Tribunal, which is intended to be played after the completion of Morrowind\u200A'\u200Bs main quest, Bloodmoon\u200A'\u200Bs main-quest is self-contained within the expansion."@en .

He spent the final season of his career as a player-coach for the New York Giants in 1941. After his playing career, he continued his involvement in baseball as a coach and as a minor league manager.Hartnett was an all-around player, performing well both offensively and defensively. Known for his strong and accurate throwing arm, he routinely led the National League's catchers in caught stealing percentage and was the first major league catcher to hit more than 20 home runs in a season. During the course of his career, he took part of some of the most memorable events in Major League Baseball history including; Babe Ruth's Called Shot during the 1932 World Series, Carl Hubbell's strike out performance in the 1934 All-Star Game and Dizzy Dean's career-altering injury during the 1937 All-Star Game. But the greatest moment of Hartnett's career came with one week left in the 1938 season, when he hit a game-winning home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to put the Cubs into first place. The event, which occurred as darkness descended onto Wrigley Field, became immortalized as the Homer in the Gloamin'.Until the career of Johnny Bench, Hartnett was considered the greatest catcher in the history of the National League. A six-time All-Star, he appeared in four World Series during his playing career. At the time of his retirement, Hartnett held the career records for catchers in home runs, runs batted in, hits, doubles and in most games played as a catcher.

It was based on Rader's original 1986 screenplay and stars Kevin Costner, who also produced it with Charles Gordon and John Davis. It was distributed by Universal Pictures.The setting of the film is in the distant future. Although no exact date was given in the film itself, it has been suggested that it takes place in 2500. The polar ice caps have completely melted, and the sea level has risen many hundreds of feet, covering nearly all the land. The film illustrates this with an unusual variation on the Universal logo, which begins with the usual image of Earth, but shows the planet's water levels gradually rising and the polar ice caps melting until nearly all the land is submerged. The plot of the film centers on an otherwise nameless antihero, \"The Mariner\", a drifter who sails the Earth in his trimaran.The most expensive film ever made at the time, Waterworld was released to mixed reviews, praising the futuristic landscape and premise but criticizing the characterization and acting performances. The film also was unable to recoup its massive budget at the box office; however, the production did later break even due to video and other post-cinema sales. The film's release was accompanied by a tie-in novel, video game, and three themed attractions at Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal Studios Singapore, and Universal Studios Japan called Waterworld: A Live Sea War Spectacular, which are all still running as of 2014."@en .

In reality, while the Zeppelins were certainly used as a propaganda symbol by the Third Reich, and anti-Nazi forces might have had the motivation for sabotage, the theory of sabotage was investigated at the time, and no firm evidence for such sabotage was ever put forward.

Players aim to gather resources, which they use to build towns, create armies, and defeat their enemies. There are five historically based campaigns, which constrict the player to specialized and story-backed conditions. There are three additional single-player game modes, and multiplayer is supported. Despite using the same game engine and similar code to its predecessor, development of The Age of Kings took a year longer than expected, forcing Ensemble Studios to release Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome in 1998 instead. The design team focused on resolving significant issues in Age of Empires, but noted on release that some problems remained.Reception of The Age of Kings was positive. The significant number of new features was praised, as were the gameplay improvements. Some reviewers were critical of the presentation of units\u2014they were seen as bland and uninteresting\u2014while others considered The Age of Kings to be overly similar to its predecessor, Age of Empires. Three months after its release, two million copies of The Age of Kings had been shipped, and it topped sales charts in seven countries. The game won multiple awards and has had a significant impact on future games in its genre. Both the original Age of Empires II and the expansion pack were later released as \"the Gold Edition\".In April 2013, Age of Empires II: HD Edition was released on the Steam digital distribution platform for Windows operating systems. The HD Edition includes both the original game and the expansion The Conquerors, as well as updated graphics for high-resolution displays. It also supports user-generated content through the Steam Workshop and multiplayer games provided through the Steam servers. On August 16, 2013 Microsoft announced The Forgotten, the first new expansion in nearly 13 years and exclusive to the HD Edition."@en .

Articles_containing_video_clips 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neolithic_Revolution> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "The Neolithic Revolution or Neolithic Demographic Transition, sometimes called the Agricultural Revolution, was the wide-scale transition of many human cultures from a lifestyle of hunting and gathering to one of agriculture and settlement, allowing the ability to support an increasingly large population. Archaeological data indicates that the domestication of various types of plants and animals evolved in separate locations worldwide, starting in the geological epoch of the Holocene around 12,000 years ago. It was the world's first historically verifiable revolution in agriculture.However, the Neolithic Revolution involved far more than the adoption of a limited set of food-producing techniques. During the next millennia it would transform the small and mobile groups of hunter-gatherers that had hitherto dominated human pre-history into sedentary (here meaning non-nomadic) societies based in built-up villages and towns. These societies radically modified their natural environment by means of specialized food-crop cultivation (e.g., irrigation and deforestation) which allowed extensive surplus food production. These developments provided the basis for densely populated settlements, specialization and division of labour, trading economies, the development of non-portable art and architecture, centralized administrations and political structures, hierarchical ideologies, depersonalized systems of knowledge (e.g., writing), and property ownership. The first full-blown manifestation of the entire Neolithic complex is seen in the Middle Eastern Sumerian cities (c.\u20095,500 BP), whose emergence also inaugurates the end of the prehistoric Neolithic period.The relationship of the above-mentioned Neolithic characteristics to the onset of agriculture, their sequence of emergence, and empirical relation to each other at various Neolithic sites remains the subject of academic debate, and seems to vary from place to place, rather than being the outcome of universal laws of social evolution."@en .

He spent the years of the Second World War in the Royal Naval Scientific Service.  After the war he worked in Canada, and then was appointed Chief Metallurgist at the Atomic Energy Authority, Harwell. The years 1948-58 which he spent there were a time of rapid development of nuclear power.  Finniston initiated and oversaw a wide-ranging research programme into the many metallurgical problems associated with nuclear reactor design, involving uranium fuel elements, their light alloy cladding, and reactor containment vessels.In 1958 he moved to north-east England to become Director of the Nuclear Research Centre newly founded by the Newcastle engineering firm C. A. Parsons.  When enthusiasm for atomic power waned in the early 1960s, he persuaded Parsons' board to convert the Centre into International Research and Development Ltd. (IRD),  a wide-ranging contract engineering research company.  He was Vice-President of the Royal Society, 1971-2.  He became chairman of British Steel in 1973, and was knighted in the same year.In 1975 he was awarded the A. A. Griffith Medal and Prize.In 1976 he was invited to deliver the Marlow (Scotland) Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. He chose the subject 'The Developing Role of Management in Industry'.In response to complaints from industry about a shortage of qualified engineers, the government in 1977 invited Finniston to set up a committee of enquiry into British engineering.  In 1979 the committee delivered the \"Finniston Report\", which addressed the concerns that engineering was of relatively low status in the UK. One of the main recommendations was that universities should offer engineering degrees (BEng and MEng) rather than just science degrees (BSc).  This report also led to the establishment of the Engineering Council in 1982, and of WISE (Women into Science and Engineering) in 1984.Sir Monty Finniston was Chancellor of Stirling University from 1979 to 1988, in succession to Lord Robbins.

Spurlock's film follows a 30-day period from February 1 to March 2, 2003 during which he ate only McDonald's food. The film documents this lifestyle's drastic effect on Spurlock's physical and psychological well-being, and explores the fast food industry's corporate influence, including how it encourages poor nutrition for its own profit.Spurlock ate at McDonald's restaurants three times per day, eating every item on the chain's menu at least once. Spurlock consumed an average of 20.92 megajoules or 5,000 kcal (the equivalent of 9.26 Big Macs) per day during the experiment.  (An intake of around 2,500kcal is more generally recommended \"within a healthy balanced diet,.. [for] a man .. to maintain his weight\") As a result, the then-32-year-old Spurlock gained 24\u00BD lbs. (11.1 kg), a 13% body mass increase, a cholesterol level of 230, and experienced mood swings, sexual dysfunction, and fat accumulation in his liver. It took Spurlock fourteen months to lose the weight gained from his experiment using a vegan diet supervised by his then-girlfriend (now ex-wife), a chef who specializes in gourmet vegan dishes.The  reason  for Spurlock's investigation was the increasing spread of obesity throughout U.S. society, which the Surgeon General has declared \"epidemic\", and the corresponding lawsuit brought against McDonald's on behalf of two overweight girls, who, it was alleged, became obese as a result of eating McDonald's food [Pelman v. McDonald's Corp., 237 F. Supp. 2d 512]. Spurlock points out that although the lawsuit against McDonald's failed (and subsequently many state legislatures have legislated against product liability actions against producers and distributors of \"fast food\"), much of the same criticism leveled against the tobacco companies applies to fast food franchises whose product is both physiologically addictive and physically harmful.The documentary was nominated for an Academy Award for Documentary Feature. A comic book related to the movie has been made with Dark Horse Comics as the publisher containing stories based on numerous cases of fast food health scares."@en .

The Gullah people and their language are also called Geechee, which some scholars speculate is related to the Ogeechee River near Savannah, Georgia. \"Gullah\" is a term that was originally used to designate the variety of English spoken by Gullah and Geechee people, but over time it has been used by its speakers to formally refer to their creole language and distinctive ethnic identity as a people. The Georgia communities are distinguished by identifying as either \"Saltwater Geechee\" or \"Freshwater Geechee,\" depending on their proximity to the coast.Because of a period of relative isolation in rural areas, the Gullah developed a culture that has preserved much of their African linguistic and cultural heritage from various peoples, as well as absorbing new influences from the region. They speak an English-based creole language containing many African loanwords and influenced by African languages in grammar and sentence structure. Properly referred to as \"Sea Island Creole,\" the Gullah language is related to Jamaican Patois, Barbadian Dialect, Bahamian Dialect, Trinidadian Creole, Belizean Creole and the Krio language of Sierra Leone in West Africa.

This brought censure from the government of Norway, which said the Australian government failed to meet its obligations to distressed mariners under international law at the United Nations. Within a few days the government introduced the Border Protection Bill into the House of Representatives saying it will confirm Australian sovereignty to \"determine who will enter and reside in Australia\".

P. Sippy. The film follows two criminals, Veeru and Jai (played by Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan), hired by a retired police officer (Sanjeev Kumar) to capture the ruthless dacoit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan). Hema Malini and Jaya Bhaduri also star, as Veeru and Jai's love interests. Sholay is considered a classic and one of the best Indian films. It was ranked first in the British Film Institute's 2002 poll of \"Top 10 Indian Films\" of all time. In 2005, the judges of the 50th annual Filmfare Awards named it the Best Film of 50 Years.The film was shot in the rocky terrain of Ramanagara, in the southern state of Karnataka, over a span of two and a half years. After the Central Board of Film Certification mandated the removal of several violent scenes, Sholay was released with a length of 198 minutes. In 1990, the original director's cut of 204 minutes became available on home media. When first released, Sholay received negative critical reviews and a tepid commercial response, but favourable word-of-mouth publicity helped it to become a box office success. It broke records for continuous showings in many theatres across India, and ran for more than five years at Mumbai's Minerva theatre. By some accounts, Sholay is the highest grossing Indian film of all time, adjusted for inflation.The film drew heavily from the conventions of Westerns, and is a defining example of the masala film, which mixes several genres in one work. Scholars have noted several themes in the film, such as glorification of violence, conformation to feudal ethos, debate between social order and mobilised usurpers, homosocial bonding, and the film's role as a national allegory. The combined sales of the original soundtrack, scored by R. D. Burman, and the dialogues (released separately), set new sales records. The film's dialogues and certain characters became extremely popular, contributing to numerous cultural memes and becoming part of India's daily vernacular. In January 2014, Sholay was re-released to theatres in the 3D format."@en .

Like the Crossroads tests, the Sandstone tests were carried out at the Pacific Proving Grounds, although at Enewetak Atoll rather than Bikini Atoll. They differed from Crossroads in that they were conducted by the Atomic Energy Commission, with the armed forces having only a supporting role. The purpose of the Sandstone tests was also different: they were primarily tests of new bomb designs rather than of the effects of nuclear weapons. Three tests were carried out in April and May 1948 by Joint Task Force 7, with a work force of 10,366 personnel, of whom 9,890 were military.The successful testing of the new cores in the Operation Sandstone tests rendered every component of the old weapons obsolete. Even before the third test had been carried out, production of the old cores was halted, and all effort concentrated on the new Mark 4 nuclear bomb, which would become the first mass-produced nuclear weapon. More efficient use of fissionable material as a result of Operation Sandstone would increase the U.S. nuclear stockpile from 56 bombs in June 1948 to 169 in June 1949."@en .

He previously served as the 26th Prime Minister of Turkey from 1983 to 1989 as the leader of the Motherland Party. He was the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey in the military government of B\u00FClend Ulusu between 1980 and 1982.After working briefly at the World Bank in the United States and as an university lecturer, \u00D6zal became the general secretary and later the leader of the main miners' trade union of Turkey in 1979, serving as a chief negotiator during large-scale industrial action in 1977. He unsuccessfully stood for Parliament in the 1977 general election as a National Salvation Party (MSP) candidate from \u0130zmir. In 1979, he became an undersecretary to Prime Minister S\u00FCleyman Demirel's minority government until the 1980 military coup. As an undersecretary, he played a major role in developing economic reforms, known as the '24th January decisions,' which paved the way for greater economic liberalism of the Turkish economy. After the coup, he was appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey responsible for the economy in B\u00FClent Ulusu's and continued to implement economic reforms. He resigned in 1982 following disagreements over economic policy.\u00D6zal formed the Motherland Party (ANAP) in 1983 after the ban on political parties were lifted by the military government. ANAP won a parliamentary majority in the 1983 general election and \u00D6zal subsequently became the Prime Minister of Turkey. While implementing several economic reforms concerning the exchange rate and deregulation, a rise in inflation and the growing conflict with Kurdish separatists led to ANAP winning reduced pluralities in the 1984 local elections. Despite a referendum in 1987 allowing politicians banned during the 1980 coup to resume political activities, ANAP was re-elected with a parliamentary majority in the 1987 general election, albeit with a reduced share of the vote. He survived an assassination attempt during a party congress in 1988. \u00D6zal's foreign policy focused on averting war with Greece following the \u015Eim\u015Fek Incident and temporarily allowed Turkish citizens in Bulgaria to return to Turkey.\u00D6zal was elected President of the Turkish Republic in the 1989 presidential election, while Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Akbulut replaced him as Prime Minister. Despite assuming a ceremonial role with minimal political duties, \u00D6zal remained occupied with government activities, such as intervening in the 1990 Zonguldak miners' strikes. While Akbulut took a docile approach as Prime Minister, disputes over the President's and Prime Minister's duties were dominant when S\u00FCleyman Demirel became Prime Minister after the 1991 general election. The Southeastern Anatolia development project began with the construction of the Atat\u00FCrk Dam in \u015Eanl\u0131urfa, while \u00D6zal participated in the first ever summit of Turkic Republics in 1992 held in Ankara.

It describes a medical sign and, generally, is not a diagnosis of a disease. These myoclonic twitches, jerks, or seizures are usually caused by sudden muscle contractions (positive myoclonus) or brief lapses of contraction (negative myoclonus). The most common circumstance under which they occur is while falling asleep (hypnic jerk), but myoclonic jerks are also a sign of a number of neurological disorders.  Hiccups are also a kind of myoclonic jerk specifically affecting the diaphragm. When a spasm is caused by another person it is known as a \"provoked spasm\". Shuddering attacks in babies also fall in this category.Myoclonic jerks may occur alone or in sequence, in a pattern or without pattern. They may occur infrequently or many times each minute. Most often, myoclonus is one of several signs in a wide variety of nervous system disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), serotonin toxicity, some cases of Huntington's disease, some forms of epilepsy, and occasionally in intracranial hypotension. Some researchers indicate that jerks persistently may even cause early tremors.In almost all instances in which myoclonus is caused by central nervous system disease it is preceded by other symptoms; for instance, in CJD it is generally a late-stage clinical feature that appears after the patient has already started to exhibit gross neurological deficits.Anatomically, myoclonus may originate from lesions of the cortex, subcortex or spinal cord. The presence of myoclonus above the foramen magnum effectively excludes spinal myoclonus, but further localisation relies on further investigation with electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG)."@en .
Articles_containing_video_clips 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pupillary_light_reflex> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "The pupillary light reflex (PLR) is a reflex that controls the diameter of the pupil, in response to the intensity (luminance) of light that falls on the retina of the pupil and the eye, thereby assisting in adaptation to various levels of lightness/darkness. A greater intensity of light causes the pupil to constrict (miosis/myosis) (allowing less light in), whereas a lower intensity of light causes the pupil to dilate (mydriasis, expansion) (allowing more light in). Thus, the pupillary light reflex regulates the intensity of light entering the eye.The pupillary light reflex pathway has an afferent limb (CN II) and efferent limb (CN III). The ganglion cells of the retina project bilaterally to the pretectal nuclei. The pretectal nuclei projects crossed and uncrossed fibers to the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, which gives rise to the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers. These fibers exit the midbrain with CN III and synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic neurons of the ciliary ganglion, which innervates the sphincter muscle of the iris."@en .

Following the acquiring of Gathering via Take-Two Interactive in 2002, the game was ported again for the Microsoft Windows by Ideas From the Deep. However, Take-Two apparently continued publishing illegal copies of Bugdom, prompting Ideas From the Deep to contact the FBI's crime division. Despite this, Take-Two continued to publish copies following the debate.Bugdom\u200A'\u200Bs story centers on the Bugdom, a kingdom inhabited by insects that appears as an outdoors bug environment. Originally, the kingdom was peacefully ruled by the rollie pollies and ladybugs, but not long ago, the kingdom was overthrown by the tyrannic and pompous King Thorax, leader of an evil clan of fire ants, as well as their evil follower bugs recruited prior to the kingdom's downfall. Thorax now rules the kingdom with an iron fist, and the ladybugs have been imprisoned in spider web cages scattered across the environment. The player assumes the role of main protagonist Rollie McFly, who has survived the ambush of the kingdom by taking refuge in the lawn area. Rollie must travel to Thorax's anthill on the distant reaches of the Bugdom, while freeing various trapped ladybugs along the way.It was generally well received by critics, being praised for its graphics, gameplay and soundtrack but criticized for certain technical glitches as well as gameplay repetition, and sold fairly well, enough to warrant a sequel, Bugdom 2, which was released on December 30, 2002, and starred a grasshopper named Skip who attempts to retrieve his stolen knapsack from a large Bully Bee as opposed to Rollie McFly.

Released in June 2000, the game became the debut title in The Creative Assembly's Total War series. Set in Japan during Sengoku jidai\u2014the \"Warring States\" period from the 15th to the beginning of the 17th century\u2014the game has players adopt the leader of a contemporary Japanese clan, attempt to conquer the nation and claim the position of shogun. The turn-based aspect of the game focuses on a map of Japan where military force, religion, diplomacy, espionage and economics all influence the player's actions, whilst battles are fought in a 3D real-time mode. Sun Tzu's The Art of War is central to the game; its precepts quoted often and its strategies recommended.Announced in early 1999, Shogun: Total War was The Creative Assembly's first high business risk product; previous products had involved creating video games for the EA Sports brand. The game was initially conceived as a real-time strategy \"B-title\" powered by 2D computer graphics following the popularisation of the genre through titles such as Command & Conquer. However, proliferation of 3D video cards amongst consumers led to a transition to 3D graphics. Through the course of development, Shogun: Total War evolved into a real-time tactics game with a focus on historical authenticity; military historian Stephen Turnbull advised The Creative Assembly in this regard. The turn-based campaign map was added to include context for the real-time battles.Shogun: Total War was well received critically, though complaints surfaced regarding glitches in the game. The game holds scores of 84% and 87% on the review aggregator sites Metacritic and GameRankings respectively. An expansion pack, The Mongol Invasion, followed in August 2001, adding a playable version of the Mongol invasions of Japan. The game's positive reception and sales paved the way for the development of successive Total War releases set in different times and regions. Total War: Shogun 2 is a sequel which returns to the Sengoku period albeit with all the improvements in graphical technology and gameplay since the first game. It was announced in June 2010 and released in March 2011."@en .

The familiar woody cone is the female cone, which produces seeds. The male cones, which produce pollen, are usually herbaceous and much less conspicuous even at full maturity. The name \"cone\" derives from the fact that the shape in some species resembles a geometric cone. The individual plates of a cone are known as scales.The male cone (microstrobilus or pollen cone) is structurally similar across all conifers, differing only in small ways (mostly in scale arrangement) from species to species. Extending out from a central axis are microsporophylls (modified leaves). Under each microsporophyll is one or several microsporangia (pollen sacs).The female cone (megastrobilus, seed cone, or ovulate cone) contains ovules which, when fertilized by pollen, become seeds. The female cone structure varies more markedly between the different conifer families, and is often crucial for the identification of many species of conifers."@en .

While the preceding games in the series, Myst and Riven, were produced by Cyan and published by Br\u00F8derbund, Exile was developed by Presto Studios and published by Ubisoft. The game was released on four compact discs for both Mac OS and Microsoft Windows on May 8, 2001; versions for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 were released in late 2002.As in previous games, the player assumes the role of the Stranger, a friend of Atrus. A member of the D'ni race, Atrus can create links to other worlds called Ages by writing descriptive books. In Exile, Atrus has written an Age for the D'ni to live on while rebuilding their civilization; it is stolen, however, by a mysterious figure. The Stranger pursues the thief in an attempt to reclaim Atrus' book.The creators of the Myst franchise gave the task of creating the third Myst game to Presto Studios, known for its adventure game series The Journeyman Project. Presto sought to develop a diverse and logical approach to puzzles and Ages, and worked to make the villain sympathetically multifaceted. The developers hired Jack Wall  to develop a musical style different from earlier composer Robyn Miller but still recognizable as a Myst game. The project required millions of US dollars and more than two years to complete.Exile was received well by critics; British newspaper The Daily Telegraph called it the best game in the Myst series. Conversely, long-time critics of the series complained that Exile continued to prove that Myst\u200A'\u200Bs slower gameplay did not belong in the fast-paced modern game market; GameSpot editor Greg Kasavin described the Myst series as having lost its relevance. Despite selling more than one million copies within the first year of release, Exile fared poorer commercially than Myst and Riven, which had sold more than 10 million copies combined. Myst IV: Revelation, the fourth game in the series, was developed and published solely by Ubisoft."@en .

The player controls a Native American warrior, Turok, who must stop the evil Campaigner from conquering the universe with an ancient and powerful weapon.As Acclaim's first exclusive title for the Nintendo 64, Turok was part of a strategy to develop games internally and license merchandise; Acclaim acquired the rights to Turok when it purchased Acclaim Comics (n\u00E9 Valiant) in 1994. Suffering from cash flow problems and falling sales, Acclaim came to rely on Turok as its best hope for a financial turnaround. Iguana pushed the Nintendo 64's graphics capabilities to its limits, and were forced to compress or cut elements to fit the game on its 8 megabyte cartridge. Bugs delayed the game's release from September 1996 to January 1997.Critical reception of Turok was highly positive. Becoming one of the most popular games for the console on release, Turok won praise for its graphics and evolution of the genre. Complaints centered on graphical slowdowns caused by multiple enemies appearing onscreen and occasionally awkward controls. The game sold 1.5 million copies and boosted sales of the Nintendo 64.

Often cited as one of rock music's first concept albums, the album is a satirical expression of frontman Frank Zappa's perception of American pop culture. It was also one of the earliest double albums in rock music (although Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde preceded it by a week), and the first 2-record debut.  In the UK the album was originally released as a single disc.The album was produced by Tom Wilson, who signed The Mothers, formerly a bar band called the Soul Giants.  Zappa said many years later that Wilson signed the group to a record deal in the belief that they were a white blues band. The album features Zappa on vocals and guitar, along with lead vocalist/tambourine player Ray Collins, bass player/vocalist Roy Estrada, drummer/vocalist Jimmy Carl Black and guitar player Elliot Ingber, who would later join Captain Beefheart's Magic Band under the name Winged Eel Fingerling.The band's original repertoire consisted of rhythm and blues covers; though after Zappa joined the band he encouraged them to play his own original material, and the name was changed to The Mothers. The musical content of Freak Out! ranges from rhythm and blues, doo-wop and standard blues-influenced rock to orchestral arrangements and avant-garde sound collages. Although the album was initially poorly received in the United States, it was a success in Europe. It gained a cult following in America, where it continued to sell in substantial quantities until it was discontinued in the early 1970s.In 1999, it was honored with the Grammy Hall of Fame Award, and in 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it among the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\" In 2006, The MOFO Project/Object, an audio documentary on the making of the album, was released in honor of its 40th anniversary."@en .

The premise involved 16 contestants vying to win US$1 million from billionaire entrepreneur and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban.In late March and early April 2004, ABC held open auditions for the show in Atlanta, Boise, Boston, Dallas and Las Vegas and also accepted auditions by mail.The show and its format were kept tightly under wraps during its filming, which began on April 30, 2004 in Dallas, Texas.  Mark Cuban purposefully kept details about the show to a minimum, eliciting only a small bit of information about the show on his personal blog during filming. Dallas journalists, eager to learn what was going on, routinely compiled sightings of Benefactor film crews around town.However, the show proved to be extremely unpopular and suffered from very low ratings, despite leading in to the popular Monday Night Football. The show also suffered from ABC stations in NFL markets (such as WBAY in Green Bay and Buffalo's WKBW-TV) moving the show to a timeslot after Jimmy Kimmel Live! or another night entirely due to local sports shows devoted to NFL coverage or local pre-game shows in the pre-MNF slot.  Episode three had only 4.9 million viewers, the network's least-watched show of that week.  Episode four did even worse, with only 4.05 million viewers and finished sixth in its time slot among 18- to 49-year-olds.The series was widely seen as a copycat and derivative of The Apprentice, a popular show of the time that was hosted by Donald Trump. The Benefactor debuted about nine months after The Apprentice did, though The Benefactor focused more on offbeat and unconventional tasks that were unrelated to business, as opposed to The Apprentice's commerce-related tasks. The Benefactor also offered a straight cash prize as opposed to an apprenticeship with salary."@en .

He came to be interested in art soon after this, and began teaching courses in design and art theory at Harvard by 1889. Ross would spend much of the rest of his life lecturing on these and related topics, working with the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston on their burgeoning Oriental Art department, and traveling the world in search of artworks to add to his personal collection. Ross was also a member of some of Boston's elite inner circles, and is known to have brushed elbows not only with other prominent people associated with the Museum of Fine Arts and the art world, but also with the likes of Louis Brandeis, John Singer Sargent, Joseph Lindon Smith and various members of Boston's most prominent families.A number of his students at Harvard, the Museum of Fine Arts, and elsewhere he lectured, went on to become prominent artists. Hyman Bloom and Jack Levine were among these.The collection of objects donated by Ross to the Museum of Fine Arts over the course of his career as a collector covers a wide geographical, chronological, and material diversity. He collected a myriad of European art objects, along with a great many Chinese and Japanese paintings and textiles. Among the many objects in the Denman Waldo Ross collection at the Museum are a stone head from Angkor Wat, a 7th-century Chinese scroll painting attributed to Yan Liben, a set of ukiyo-e folding screen paintings of Kyoto's pleasure quarters, and a number of Chinese Buddhist steles and paintings.In 1907 he published a manual of design : \"A Theory of Pure Design, Harmony, Balance, Rhythm\" by Houghton-Mifflin and co."@en .

Whilst a student he founded the short-lived Zetetical Society.  In 1830 he began working for the family wine business.  This job required him to travel throughout the United Kingdom and also abroad to France and Belgium, and during the course of these travels he made many geological observations.  He became a Fellow of Geological Society in 1833 and published his first paper there two years later.  His 1836 memoir on the Geology of Coalbrookdale, based upon observations made during 1831 and 1832, established his reputation as a geologist.From 1846 his attention focused upon the Tertiary deposits of the London Basin, which he subsequently classified and then correlated with Tertiary deposits throughout England, France and Belgium.  In 1858 Prestwich was persuaded by Hugh Falconer to visit Abbeville, where Boucher de Perthes had claimed to have found flint tools in the gravel deposits of the valley of the Somme, thus establishing the antiquity of man. In company with John Evans, Prestwich visited the gravel beds of St Acheul and confirmed the observations of Boucher de Perthes.  Prestwich's report on the matter was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society for 1859-1860: It is claimed by some authorities that this publication marks the birth of modern scientific archaeology.During the late 1860s Prestwich served on the Royal Coal Commission and the Royal Commission on the Metropolitan Water Supply.  In 1870\u20131872 he was president of the Geological Society.  In 1874 he was appointed to the chair of geology at the University of Oxford.  Here he produced in two volumes Geology, Chemical and Physical, Stratigraphical and Palaeontological.  In 1888 he retired from Oxford to Shoreham in Kent where he continued to work until his death in 1896. Prestwich was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1853, awarded its Royal Medal in 1865, and knighted in 1896. He married Grace Anne McCall, the niece of Hugh Falconer, in 1870."@en .

The Beta Pictoris system is very young, only 8\u201320 million years old, although it is already in the main sequence stage of its evolution. Beta Pictoris is the title member of the Beta Pictoris moving group, an association of young stars which share the same motion through space and have the same age.Beta Pictoris shows an excess of infrared emission compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas (including carbon monoxide) near the star. Detailed observations reveal a large disk of dust and gas orbiting the star, which was the first debris disk to be imaged around another star. In addition to the presence of several planetesimal belts and cometary activity, there are indications that planets have formed within this disk and that the processes of planet formation may still be ongoing. Material from the Beta Pictoris debris disk is thought to be the dominant source of interstellar meteoroids in our solar system.The European Southern Observatory (ESO) has confirmed the presence of a planet, Beta Pictoris b, matching previous predictions, through the use of direct imagery, orbiting in the plane of the debris disk surrounding the star.

It centered around the adventures of an eight-year-old girl named Angela who lived in the fictional town of Tapwater Springs, and her life with wacky brothers, weird friends, and a snobbish faux-French girl named Nanette Manoir.Angela Anaconda began as a short skit on the Nickelodeon show Kablam!. It later became a series and aired on Fox Family from 1999 to 2002. Each episode consisted of two 11-minute stories. In 2001, when Disney bought Fox Family and changed the network's name to ABC Family, Angela was moved and canceled after two months. Reruns returned to Nickelodeon in 2004 only to be removed about a month later.The show was created by Joanna Ferrone and Sue Rose, the latter of whom who also voices Angela. Sue Rose created the cartoon character Fido Dido as well as Disney's Pepper Ann and Nickelodeon's Unfabulous. The show was produced by DHX Media and C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures. It premiered on Cartoon Network in the UK, and also aired there on PopGirl; it also aired on POP TV in Slovenia and ABC1 and ABC2 in Australia.The show featured a very distinct art style of Clip Art Animation, reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's animation from Monty Python's Flying Circus, in which all the characters were made out of cutouts of black-and-white photographs. The studio would have different models come in and take about 30 or more pictures for each mouth movement, then use Elastic Reality software to animate it.The show now airs on Starz Kids & Family. There are currently no plans for a DVD release of the full series, although Channel 4 released the first 20 episodes across three separate DVDs in the UK. The first 20 episodes have also been released across four volumes in Australia. Mill Creek Entertainment announced the series on DVD."@en .

The title cards he wrote for Harold Lloyd, Charley Chase, Our Gang and Laurel and Hardy comedies \"have entered legend, both for silent films, and as opening remarks for the earlier talkies.\" He was also an officer of the Roach Studio corporation.Like many screenwriters of his time, notably Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, Walker came to the screen trade from the freewheeling world of newspaper journalism. He was a sports writer for the Los Angeles Examiner before joining Roach.On Roach's \"Lot of Fun\", script development usually started with meetings among the gag men, who would develop what was known as an \"action script\": the outline of the story and a description of the scenes and some of the sight gags, which generally would run three to six legal-size pages. This document would then pass to Walker, the head of the editorial department, which oversaw not only script editing, but film editing as well. Walker usually came up with the title of each film, wrote \"brilliantly witty\" title cards which would be produced and inserted into the film, and wrote a critique before the picture went out to the distributors, Path\u00E9 Exchange, or later, M-G-M.Walker was a chain-smoking eccentric, a cat fanatic whose office always had a few tabbies in residence. His exterior was gruff and he was often difficult to get along with. Director Tay Garnett had an early-career one-day trial as an assistant writer to Walker, whose only reaction to Garnett's efforts was a guttural \"yeah.\" Then, Garnett, \"who soon discovered Walker's 'yeah's to be the equivalent to a round of applause, was told 'Come back tomorrow\u2014on salary.'\" Film Editor Richard Currier recounted that Walker never drove a car, so his wife had to drive him to work every day. But Currier was fond of Walker, calling him \"a prince of a guy,\" and remembered the present of a dictionary with a note that read like one of Waker's title cards: \"Having listened for years to your astonishing, and, at times, highly-charged vocabulary, I hasten to add to your voltage.\"As sound came to motion pictures, Walker and his staff were writing cards for Roach series considered today as classics, notably the Our Gang and Laurel and Hardy comedy short subjects. But as witty as his title cards had been, Walker was less adept at writing the spoken dialogue required by talkies. \"Much of his work for Laurel and Hardy was so unwieldy and out of character that complete on-set revision was necessary,\" says The Laurel and Hardy Encyclopedia. Laurel and Hardy scholar Randy Skretvedt writes that Walker's \"contribution to the L&H films was relatively minor\" and that comparison of the \"action\" and \"dialogue\" scripts with the finished film \"usually reveals that most of Walker's dialogue went unused.\"Things came to a head with the arrival at Roach of new-broom general manager Henry Ginsburg in 1931, a boorish man universally despised on the lot and called by Stan Laurel \"The Expeditor\". Ginsburg's every move was aimed at dumping costs, often at great harm to the studio's creative output. One of the first casualties was cameraman George Stevens, who would go on to win two Oscars for Best Director. Among the next was Beanie Walker, who resigned after sixteen years over disputes with Ginsburg's cost-cutting edicts.After leaving the Roach studio, Walker wrote dialogue for comedies produced by ex-Roach general manager Warren Doane at Universal Pictures. Later, he worked at Paramount Pictures, where he contributed to the W. C. Fields picture The Old Fashioned Way (1934)."@en .

El Capit\u00E1n (\"the captain\", \"the chief\") was taken to be a loose Spanish translation of the local Native American name for the cliff, variously transcribed as \"To-to-kon oo-lah\" or \"To-tock-ah-noo-lah\".

She unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Party nomination for Governor after Pataki dropped her from his 1998 ticket, and ended up on the ballot under the Liberal party line.A historian by training, with a Ph.D. from Columbia University, McCaughey has, over the years, provided conservative media commentary on U.S. public policy affecting healthcare-related issues. Her 1993 attack on the Clinton healthcare plan was likely a major factor in the initially-popular bill's defeat in Congress; also, it brought her to the attention of Republican Pataki, who chose her as his Lieutenant Governor nominee/running mate. In 2009, her criticisms of the Affordable Care Act -- then a bill being debated in Congress -- again gained significant media attention in TV and radio interviews, and may have specifically inspired the \"death panel\" claim about the act.She has been a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute and Hudson Institute think tanks, and has written numerous articles and op-eds. She was a member of the boards of directors of medical equipment companies Genta (from 2001 to 2007) and Cantel Medical Corporation, until she resigned in 2009 to avoid the appearance of conflict-of-interest, given her public advocacy against the Affordable Care Act legislation."@en .

Depending on building design, sill heights, fueling positions and operational requirements, it may be fixed or movable, swinging radially or extending in length. The jetway was invented by Frank Der Yuen.Before the introduction of jet bridges, passengers normally boarded an aircraft by walking along the ground-level ramp and climbing a set of movable stairs, or up airstairs on aircraft so equipped. Mobile staircases or \"ramp stairs\" are employed at many airports around the world, particularly smaller airports and terminals supporting low cost carriers.The first jet bridge in the United States was installed on July 29, 1959 at San Francisco International Airport."@en .

As the first racing game to incorporate this feature, Sega Rally is considered to be one of the milestones in the evolution of the racing game genre.

In fact one could even technically can consider this series as a pseudo reboot of that franchise. He was conceived as a bionic \"child\" with the personality of a \"perfect adult detective\" (although as with the aforementioned Inspector Gadget, he is anything but). Just as maladroit as the original Inspector Gadget, Gadget Boy was usually bailed out of situations by the more practical Heather, though he was also helped greatly by his myriad high-tech gadgets and extendable arms and legs. Gadget Boy's bionic implants were installed by Switzerland-based inventor Myron Dabble (Maurice LaMarche) who has an unrequited crush on Heather. Gadget Boy and Heather receive their assignments from Italy-based Chief Stromboli (Maurice LaMarche), who, much like Chief Quimby, is a frequent, long-suffering victim of Gadget Boy's bungling. Gadget Boy is assisted by the beautiful and resourceful agent Heather (Tara Charandoff), a very tall equivalent of sorts to Penny (the difference being that Heather is in her late teens or early 20s). He is also assisted by a robotic dog named G-9 (Maurice LaMarche), who serves as the \"Brain\" of this series, which shows through his morphing capabilities to get the gang out of the stickiest situations.The main villain of this series, instead of Dr. Claw, is the mask-wearing six-armed villainess Spydra (Louise Vallance) who is accompanied by Boris, a frequently abused, wisecracking, sarcastic vulture with a Russian accent, along with her henchmen Mulch and his twin brother Houmous, all played by Maurice LaMarche.The main title theme song was written and performed by Mike Piccirillo.

The album consists mostly of stark, sparsely arranged ballads concerning issues such as racism, poverty, and social change. The title track is one of Dylan's most famous; many feel that it captures the spirit of social and political upheaval that characterized the 1960s.Some critics and fans were not quite as taken with the album as a whole, relative to his previous work, for its lack of humor or musical diversity. Still, The Times They Are a-Changin' peaked at #20 on the US chart, eventually going gold, and belatedly reaching #4 in the UK in 1965."@en .

His namesake was his grandfather John Marshall Harlan, another associate justice who served from 1877 to 1911.Harlan was a student at Upper Canada College and Appleby College and then at Princeton University. He continued his education at Balliol College, Oxford. Upon his return to the U.S. in 1923 Harlan worked in the law firm of Root, Clark, Buckner & Howland while studying at New York Law School. Later he served as Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and as Special Assistant Attorney General of New York. In 1954 Harlan was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and a year later president Dwight Eisenhower nominated Harlan to the United States Supreme Court following the death of Justice Robert H. Jackson.Harlan is often characterized as a member of the conservative wing of the Warren Court. He advocated a limited role for the judiciary, remarking that the Supreme Court should not be considered \"a general haven for reform movements\". In general, Harlan adhered more closely to precedent, and was more reluctant to overturn legislation, than many of his colleagues on the Court. He strongly disagreed with the doctrine of incorporation, which held that the provisions of the federal Bill of Rights applied to the state governments, not merely the Federal. At the same time, he advocated a broad interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, arguing that it protected a wide range of rights not expressly mentioned in the United States Constitution. Harlan is sometimes called the \"great dissenter\" of the Warren Court, and has been described as one of the most influential Supreme Court justices in the twentieth century. Justice Harlan was gravely ill when he retired from the Supreme Court on September 23, 1971. He died from spinal cancer three months later, on December 29, 1971. After Harlan's retirement, President Nixon appointed William Rehnquist to replace him."@en .

The player is summoned by Atrus, a man who creates links to other worlds known as Ages by writing special linking books. Almost twenty years earlier, Atrus' two sons nearly destroyed all of his linking books and were imprisoned; Atrus now wishes to see if his sons' imprisonment has reformed them. The player ends up traveling to each brother's prison, in an effort to recover Atrus' daughter Yeesha from the brothers' plot.Development of Revelation lasted more than three years; Ubisoft had as many as eighty employees working on the game.

Although Belknap served with distinction in the Civil War, his tenure as President Grant's Secretary of War was controversial, for having indirectly sold weapons to France and for accepting illicit kickbacks in exchange for making a tradership appointment. The latter led to his resignation, impeachment by the House, and trial in the Senate during the summer of 1876.Belknap, a native of New York, graduated from Princeton college in 1848, studied law at Georgetown University, and passed the bar in 1851. Belknap moved to Iowa and started a law practice and partnership.  Belknap entered politics as a Democrat and was elected Representative in Iowa legislature in 1857.  When the Civil War broke out in spring 1861, Belknap joined Union Army and was eventually promoted Brevet Maj. General in 1865 for his gallantry during Maj. Gen. Sherman's Atlanta Campaign earlier in 1864. In hand-to-hand combat at Atlanta, Belknap crossed an entrenchment, captured the Confederate commander, and physically dragged him over to the Union side.  Belknap was appointed Iowa Collector of Internal Revenue by President Andrew Johnson and served four years. In 1869, President Grant appointed Belknap Secretary of War. As secretary, Belknap requisitioned portrait paintings by various artists for previous Secretaries of War to be displayed in honor of the United States Centennial. He also aided Chicago Fire victims in 1871 and pardoned James Webster Smith, America's first African American cadet at West Point. During the Reconstruction Era, Belknap's War Department and the U.S. military worked under supervision of President Ulysses S. Grant and the U.S. Attorney General's office to vigorously enforce the mandates of this policy upon the defeated South.Belknap was the only former Cabinet secretary ever to have been impeached by the House of Representatives. A Congressional investigation in 1876 revealed that Belknap had received kickback payments in return for a lucrative contract. Starting in 1870, Belknap and two successive wives had taken quarterly payments for the award of a Fort Sill \"tradership\" position, immediately after Belknap had been given sole authority to appoint post-traderships by Congress.  Belknap resigned his position as Secretary of War shortly before being impeached by the House. President Grant had accepted his resignation before the House voted on Belknap's impeachment, later that same day.  Belknap was tried in the Senate, but was acquitted when the vote for conviction failed to achieve the required two-thirds majority. A significant number of Senators believed that the Senate did not have jurisdiction to put a private citizen on trial.  Belknap, with his reputation damaged, returned to his law practice until his death in 1890. Historians have debated how much Belknap's second and third wives influenced Belknap into accepting Fort Sill profit money from appointed sutler Caleb P. Marsh."@en .

They are placed along with other drongos in the family Dicruridae. They are conspicuous in the forest habitats often perching in the open and by attracting attention with a wide range of loud calls that include perfect imitations of many other birds. It has been suggested that these imitations may help in the formation of mixed-species foraging flocks, a feature seen in forest bird communities where many insect feeders forage together. These drongos will sometimes steal insect prey caught or disturbed by other foragers in the flock. They are diurnal but are active well before dawn and late at dusk. Owing to their widespread distribution and distinctive regional variation, they have become iconic examples of speciation by isolation and genetic drift."@en .

Peter Medawar, the 1960 Nobel Laureate in Medicine, called it \"the finest work of literature in all the annals of science that have been recorded in the English tongue\". The book led the way for the scientific explanation of morphogenesis, the process by which patterns are formed in plants and animals. Thompson recognised, however, that the book was descriptive, and did not present experimental hypotheses.Thompson's description of the mathematical beauty of nature stimulated thinkers such as Alan Turing and artists including Henry Moore and Jackson Pollock.

Essentially that show's polar opposite, Superstar USA told contestants they were looking for the best singer when they were actually looking for the worst.  Hosted by Brian McFayden (Ryan Seacrest's double), people first audition before three judges (the sarcastic Briggs, who also produces the show and could be considered the \"Simon\" of the show; rapper Tone L\u014Dc, the show's answer to Randy Jackson; and singer Vitamin C, put into Paula Abdul's role) in four cities across the United States.  Finalists were chosen based on the lie that they were the most likely to be able to parlay their win into a successful recording contract based on talent. However, the audition process was the opposite of American Idol as good singers were mocked and told no, while bad singers were given gushing praise and passed to the next round.Said finalists were subjected to makeovers where they were encouraged to emulate pop stars.  Contestants would then be falsely encouraged and praised by the judges as well as the stylists, choreographers and vocal coaches; in particular, they would be encouraged to try and stretch their vocal range far beyond what they could actually reach. Contestants with charistmatic personalities, such as the singer/songwriter pro-cheerleader Nina \"Diva\", were heavily encouraged to follow all of the producer driven directives.  Eventually the contest was \"won\" by a singer named Jamie Foss, a buxom young blonde girl (who bore a resemblance to Jessica Simpson) who could barely carry a tune. Throughout the competition she was constantly mocked by judges with thinly veiled references to the largeness of her breasts.

The truth was revealed to her on stage in front of the audience she had just sung for, but Foss did not seem very upset with the truth.One producer, worried that the live audience members would not be able to respectfully compose themselves during the final performances, deceived the audience by falsely informing them that the singers were all terminally ill young people, who were having a wish fulfilled by a charitable organization. The Los Angeles Times reported the organization named by the producer was the Make a Wish Foundation, which later received an apology from the WB.  In an interview with USA Today, executive producer Mike Fleiss straightened out the details: \"First of all, it was me.  But I did not say 'Make-A-Wish.'

It was released in November 1967 and went on to reach No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart. It was also their American breakthrough, becoming a massive seller there in 1968, reaching No. 4 on the American charts. The album was No. 1 for two weeks on the Australian album chart and was listed as the No. 1 album of 1968 by Cash Box in the year-end album chart in the United States. The album features the two singles \"Strange Brew\" and \"Sunshine of Your Love\".The title of the album is based on a malapropism. Eric Clapton had been thinking of buying a racing bicycle and was discussing it with Ginger Baker, when a roadie named Mick Turner commented, \"it's got them Disraeli Gears\", meaning to say \"derailleur gears\", but instead alluding to 19th-century British Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli. The band thought this was hilarious, and decided that it should be the title of their next album.The original 11-track album was remastered in 1998, and then subsequently released as a two-disc Deluxe Edition in 2004.In 1999, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.In 2003 the album was ranked No. 114 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

Taylor was \"essentially homeless\" at the time the album was recorded, either staying in Asher's home or crashing on a couch at the house of guitarist Danny Kortchmar or anyone else who would have him.The song \"Suite for 20 G\" was so named because Taylor was promised $20,000 once the album was delivered.

It is based on Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay's 1929 Bengali novel of the same name and is Ray's directorial debut. It features Subir Banerjee, Kanu Banerjee, Karuna Banerjee, Uma Dasgupta and Chunibala Devi. The first film in the Apu trilogy, Pather Panchali depicts the childhood of the protagonist Apu (Subir Banerjee) and his elder sister Durga (Uma Dasgupta), and the harsh village life of their poor family.Production was interrupted due to funding problems and it took nearly three years for the film to be completed. The film was shot mainly on location, had a limited budget, featured mostly amateur actors, and was made by an inexperienced crew. The sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar composed the film's soundtrack and score using classical Indian ragas. Subrata Mitra was in charge of the cinematography while editing was handled by Dulal Dutta. Following its premiere on 3 May 1955 during an exhibition at New York's Museum of Modern Art, Pather Panchali was released in Calcutta later the same year to an enthusiastic reception. A special screening was attended by the Chief Minister of West Bengal and the Prime Minister of India. Critics have praised its realism, humanity and soul-stirring quality, while others have called its slow pace a drawback, and some have condemned it for romanticising poverty. Scholars have commented on the film's lyrical quality and realism (influenced by Italian neorealism), its portrayal of the poverty and small delights of daily life, and the use of what the author Darius Cooper has termed the \"epiphany of wonder\", among other themes.The tale of Apu's life is continued in the two subsequent installments of Ray's Apu trilogy: Aparajito (The Unvanquished, 1956)  and Apur Sansar (The World of Apu, 1959). Pather Panchali is described as a turning point in Indian cinema, as it was among the films that pioneered the Parallel Cinema movement, which espoused authenticity and social realism. The first film from independent India to attract major international critical attention, it won India's National Film Award for Best Feature Film in 1955, the Best Human Document award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, and several other awards, establishing Ray as one of the country's most distinguished filmmakers. It is often featured in several lists of great films."@en .

The_Football_League_players,English_footballers 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jackie_Milburn> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "John Edward Thompson 'Jackie' Milburn, (11 May 1924 \u2013 9 October 1988), also known (particularly in North East England) as Wor Jackie (a Geordie dialectal version of 'Our Jackie') and also as the First World Wor (in reference to his global fame), was a football player principally associated with Newcastle United and England, though he also spent four seasons at Linfield F.C.Second cousin to Bobby Charlton and Jack Charlton, Milburn played two trial matches at St James' Park as a 19-year-old in 1943. In the second of these he scored six second half goals. Milburn made his competitive debut in the FA Cup in the 1945/6 season and was initially deployed on the left wing as a supplier to Charlie Wayman. However, Wayman was dropped before a 4-0 defeat to eventual winners Charlton Athletic F.C. in a 1947 FA Cup semi-final and when he afterwards vowed not to play for United again, manager George Martin made the decision to switch Milburn to centre forward. In his next match, on 18 October 1947, Milburn wore the number nine shirt for the first time and scored a hat-trick.Milburn's subsequent achievements, particularly his two goals which won the 1951 FA Cup Final and his 45-second opener in the 1955 FA Cup Final which was the fastest ever FA Cup Final goal until it was beaten by Roberto Di Matteo in 1997, brought him national recognition and afforded him iconic status on Tyneside. In total Milburn played in three FA Cup winning finals for United; 1951, 1952 and 1955. Despite his achievements, Milburn was reportedly an extremely shy and self-deprecating individual whose modesty further endeared him to Newcastle United supporters, though according to Tom Finney this stemmed from an 'innate inferiority complex'.By the time Milburn left Newcastle in 1957, he had become the highest goalscorer in Newcastle United's history. He remained so until he was surpassed by Alan Shearer in February 2006. Milburn remains Newcastle's second highest goalscorer having scored 200 competitive goals. Despite this, Milburn's transfer to Lingfield F.C. in 1957 was almost jeopardised when the Newcastle board demanded a substantial signing fee and, much to the anger of fans, Milburn was not immediately granted a testimonial. His signing for Linfield 'added thousands to the gate' and he scored 154 goals in four seasons in all competitions for the club.After retiring, Milburn became a football journalist for the News of the World. He was finally granted a testimonial in 1967 which was attended by over 45,000 supporters at St James' Park and in 1981 he was the subject of an episode of television show This is your life. Milburn was the first footballer to be made a Freeman of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne \u2013 an honour later also bestowed on former opponent Bobby Robson and the man who surpassed his Newcastle United goalscoring records, Shearer. Milburn died of lung cancer in October 1988, aged 64. His funeral took place on 13 October 1998 and was attended by over 1,000 mourners at St Nicholas's Cathedral in Newcastle. Tens of thousands of people lined the streets to watch the cortege pass. A statue of Milburn, costing \u00A335,000 and paid for by donations received from Newcastle United supporters was erected on Newcastle's Northumberland Street before it was relocated in 1999 to St James' Boulevard and then moved again to its present position on Strawberry Place, just outside of St. James' Park. Milburn was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in October 2006. In 2008 Excelsior Academy School in Newcastle's West End was assigned the official name 'Milburn School of Sport and Health-related Studies. In 2009, Goal.com listed Milburn as 43rd in their list of the 'Top English Players of all-time'."@en .

Articles_containing_video_clips 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Batting_(cricket)> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "In the sport of cricket, batting is the act or skill of hitting the cricket ball with a cricket bat to score runs or prevent the loss of one's wicket. A player who is currently batting is denoted as a batsman, while the act of hitting the ball is called a shot or stroke. The term specialist batsman are also used generically to describe players who specialise in batting (as opposed to e.g. bowlers who specialise in bowling), and the term batsman is also used in this context. The latter term can, however, refer to any player during their turn at bat. In women's cricket, the term batswoman is sometimes encountered, as is batter, but the \"male\" form is widely used in both men's and women's cricket.During an innings two members of the batting side are on the pitch at any time: the one facing the current delivery from the bowler is denoted the striker, while the other is the non-striker. When a batsman is out, he is replaced by a teammate. This continues until the end of the innings or 10 of the team members are out, whereupon the other team gets a turn to bat.Batting tactics and strategy vary depending on the type of match being played as well as the current state of play. The main concerns for the batsmen are not to lose their wicket and to score as many runs as quickly as possible. These objectives generally conflict \u2013 to score quickly, risky shots must be played, increasing the chance that the batsman will be dismissed. Depending on the situation, batsmen may forgo attempts at run-scoring in an effort to preserve their wicket, or may attempt to score runs as quickly as possible with scant concern for the possibility of being dismissed.As with all other cricket statistics, batting statistics and records are given much attention and provide a measure of a player's effectiveness. The main statistic for batting is a player's batting average. This is calculated by dividing the number of runs he has scored, not by the innings he has played, but by the number of times he has been dismissed. In limited overs cricket an additional important statistic is the strike rate, the rate at which a batsman scores his runs (number of runs scored divided by number of balls faced).Sir Donald Bradman set many batting records, some as far back as the 1930s and still unbeaten, and he is widely regarded as the greatest batsman of all time. In the modern era, Sachin Tendulkar is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen, with the most centuries both in the test and 50 overs format, most runs in the Test and 50 overs formats, the third highest score of 200 not out in one day cricket, among other records."@en .

After that single season he returned to Tottenham and played 230 games as a defensive midfielder before leaving in 1949. He started his managerial career with amateur team Pegasus followed by Bradford Park Avenue, then a Football League side, before taking over at West Bromwich Albion in 1953. He became the club's longest serving post-war manager, almost leading them to an elusive 'double' in 1954 when they won the FA Cup and finished second in the league. During his management of Ajax, he spotted the young Johan Cruijff who was to go on to develop Buckingham's ideas into the mature concept of Total Football. Buckingham's ideas were radically ahead of his time - engendering total football philosophies and youth systems - and earned him a continental reputation (especially in Spain where he was appointed coach of Sevilla FC and then FC Barcelona) that more often than not, overshadowed his talent back home. However, his reputation in his native country was tarnished by his association with match fixing in the British betting scandal of 1964, revealed shortly after his spell as manager of Sheffield Wednesday. Although the allegations were never proven against him, three of his players at Wednesday \u2013 Peter Swan, Tony Kay and David Layne \u2013 were accused of taking bribes to fix a match with Ipswich Town on 1 December 1962 and betting on their team to lose.[1]While Buckingham was one of the first English managers to coach top European sides like Ajax Amsterdam and FC Barcelona, and has Johan Cruyff as one of his biggest fans, he remained largely unremembered in his native England. He died in Chichester, England in 1995."@en .

For other people by this name, see James Evans.James Evans (January 18, 1801 \u2013 November 23, 1846) was an English-Canadian Methodist missionary and amateur linguist. He is best remembered for his creation of the \"syllabic\" writing system for Ojibwe and Cree, which was later adapted to other languages such as Inuktitut.Evans was born in Kingston-upon-Hull in England, but emigrated with his parents to Lower Canada in 1820, where he worked as a teacher. He later moved to Rice Lake and continued his teaching work.In 1833 he was ordained as a Wesleyan (Methodist) minister, and in 1840 he was given authority over the local district in Norway House in Manitoba. During this time Evans did his greatest work - the development of the Ojibwe and Cree scripts. Evans had picked up Ojibwe during his work among the people in Upper Canada. He created the Ojibwe script after first trying to apply a Roman script to their language. Later, he modified syllabics slightly and applied it to Cree, a related language. The scripts were based on Devanagari and Pitman Shorthand. They were easy to learn and led to almost universal literacy among the Canadian Ojibwe and Cree within a few years.Evans's other missionary work was scarred by turmoil. Evans clashed several times with the Hudson's Bay Company, mostly over their treatment of the native population. After Evans accidentally shot and killed his friend and co-worker Thomas Hassall in 1844, he became increasingly unstable. He was accused of sexual misconduct with native girls under his care. Although he was acquitted, he was sent to London to defend himself again. The stress took a toll on his health, and he died of a heart attack in 1846.James Evans's grave was found in England. Then Evans's remains were cremated and sent to Norway House, Manitoba for his final resting place."@en .

The Trident II Strategic Weapons System is an improved Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile with greater accuracy, payload, and range than the Trident C-4, strengthening U.S. strategic deterrence. The Trident II is considered to be a durable sea-based system capable of engaging many targets. It enhances the U.S. position in strategic arms negotiation with performance and payload flexibility that can accommodate active treaty initiatives (See New START). The TRIDENT II's increased payload allows nuclear deterrence to be accomplished with fewer submarines.Trident II missiles are carried by 14 US Ohio and 4 British Vanguard-class submarines, with 24 missiles on each Ohio class and 16 missiles on each Vanguard class.

At that time, he approached the programming managers at Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) about a half-hour-long wildlife Series, the first to focus exclusively upon the flora and fauna of North America. PBS signed for the rights to broadcast Marty Stouffer's series Wild America in 1981. The series went on to become one of the most popular aired by PBS, renowned for its unflinching portrayal of nature, as well as its extensive use of film techniques such as slow motion and close-ups. Stouffer earned as much as $250,000 per show from PBS.The show's production ran from 1981 to 1995. The series is no longer on PBS; reruns still air in syndication on commercial television through much of the United States.

Therefore rogue waves are not necessarily the biggest waves found at sea; they are, rather, unusually large waves for a given sea state.

His primary field of specialization was physical anthropology, including Aleutian-Siberian studies, human biology, population history and human evolution. Laughlin first came to Alaska in 1938 as a member of the Smithsonian Expedition to the Aleutian Islands, directed by Dr. Ales Hrdlicka. In 1948, he was the field director for the Peabody Museum's Expedition to the Aleutians. Over the years, he made over twenty trips to the Aleutians to study its peoples.

An African American born into slavery in Virginia, he was freed by his father (and master) and apprenticed to a blacksmith; later he moved to the American West. As a fur trapper, he lived with the Crow for years. He is credited with the discovery of Beckwourth Pass through the Sierra Nevada (U.S.) Mountains between present-day Reno, Nevada and Portola, California during the California Gold Rush years, and improved the Beckwourth Trail, which thousands of settlers followed to central California.He narrated his life story to Thomas D. Bonner, an itinerant justice of the peace.  The book was published in New York and London in 1856 as The Life and Adventures of James P. Beckwourth: Mountaineer, Scout and Pioneer, and Chief of the Crow Nation of Indians.  A translation was published in France in 1860.Early historians of the Old West originally considered the book little more than campfire lore. It has since been reassessed as a valuable source of social history, especially for life among the Crow, although not all its details are reliable or accurate.

He served as the 43rd lieutenant governor of California from 1983 to 1995.McCarthy was born in Auckland, but moved with his parents to San Francisco, California at the age of four. He went to elementary school at Mission Dolores. He then went to high school at St. Ignatius College Preparatory in San Francisco, and also attended college and law school within the city, receiving his B.A. in history from the University of San Francisco and a law degree from San Francisco Law School.McCarthy served in the United States Air Force, 1951\u20131952, during the Korean War, briefly taking part in a Strategic Air Command mission to Saudi Arabia to simulate the start of World War III.In 1958, the year that saw the Democrats capture statewide offices for the first time since World War II, McCarthy managed the successful campaign for State Senate of John Eugene McAteer, and, after the election, served as McAteer's administrative assistant.McCarthy first ran for office himself in 1963 when he was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. He served there until 1967. In 1968, he was elected to the State Assembly, serving as speaker of the Assembly from 1974 to 1980. (Art Agnos, elected mayor of San Francisco in 1988, had his political start as McCarthy's first legislative assistant, and later as the speaker's chief of staff.) As speaker, McCarthy earned a reputation as a partisan, take-no-prisoners insider in Democratic Party politics.McCarthy unexpectedly lost the speakership to Willie Brown in 1980. McCarthy had been facing a stiff challenge from Howard Berman. Seeing his fellow Democrats so divided Brown worked with Republicans to gain the speakership. Both of the losers in this struggle soon left the legislature. Berman ran for Congress and McCarthy ran for statewide office.McCarthy was first elected to statewide office to the first of three consecutive four-year terms as lieutenant governor of California in 1982, at the same time that Republican George Deukmejian was elected governor. In 1986, the incumbent McCarthy ran against Republican Mike Curb, a former film producer and music promoter with a reputation for opposing drug use by artists. In a hotly contested race for lieutenant governor that centered largely around violent crime and drug policy, McCarthy sought to denigrate Curb's image with voters as an anti-drug campaigner by alleging that Curb made a fortune in making 'exploitation films' that glorified drugs, sex, and violence. Curb was so incensed at the charges that he filed a $7-million libel and slander suit against Leo T. McCarthy. McCarthy won the election.Despite his election to lieutenant governor, the controversy surrounding the McCarthy campaign's tactics in the 1986 race was never fully dispelled, and in 1988, McCarthy lost an election bid for the United States Senate against the Republican incumbent, Pete Wilson. McCarthy later won a third term as lieutenant governor in 1990, with Wilson winning the election for governor.In 1992, McCarthy entered the Democratic primary election for the U.S. Senate, but lost the nomination to Congresswoman (now Senator) Barbara Boxer. McCarthy retired from public office at the end of his third term as lieutenant governor on January 2, 1995, having been prohibited from seeking re-election to a fourth term in office due to term limits in state law and was succeeded by fellow Democratic then-State Controller and future Governor Gray Davis. McCarthy's twelve years are the longest any California lieutenant governor has served. Upon leaving politics, he created an investment company, The Daniel Group, named for his father and located in San Francisco.He helped found the Leo T. McCarthy Center for Public Service and the Common Good at the University of San Francisco.McCarthy was married on December 17, 1955 to the former Jacqueline Lee Burke. They had four children: Sharon, Conna, Adam and Niall. They had eleven grandchildren: Courtney, Kevin, Kieran, Cormac, Kathlyn, Marisa, Thomas, Collin, Connor, Kate and, Jack.

It was a direct action campaign of tax resistance and nonviolent protest against the British salt monopoly in colonial India, and triggered the wider Civil Disobedience Movement. This was the most significant organised challenge to British authority since the Non-cooperation movement of 1920\u201322, and directly followed the Purna Swaraj declaration of independence by the Indian National Congress on 26 January 1930.Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (commonly called Mahatma Gandhi) led the Dandi march from his base, Sabarmati Ashram near Ahmedabad, to the coastal village of Dandi, located at a small town called Navsari, in the state of Gujarat. As he continued on this 24-day, 240-mile (390 km) march to Dandi to produce salt without paying the tax, growing numbers of Indians joined him along the way. When Gandhi broke the salt laws at 6:30 am on 6 April 1930, it sparked large scale acts of civil disobedience against the British Raj salt laws by millions of Indians. The campaign had a significant effect on changing world and British attitude towards Indian independence and caused large numbers of Indians to join the fight for the first time.After making salt at Dandi, Gandhi continued southward along the coast, producing salt and addressing meetings on the way. The Congress Party planned to stage a satyagraha at the Dharasana Salt Works, 25 miles south of Dandi. However, Gandhi was arrested on the midnight of 4\u20135 May 1930, just days before the planned action at Dharasana. The Dandi March and the ensuing Dharasana Satyagraha drew worldwide attention to the Indian independence movement through extensive newspaper and newsreel coverage. The satyagraha against the salt tax continued for almost a year, ending with Gandhi's release from jail and negotiations with Viceroy Lord Irwin at the Second Round Table Conference. Over 80,000 Indians were jailed as a result of the Salt Satyagraha. However, it failed to result in major concessions from the British.The Salt Satyagraha campaign was based upon Gandhi's principles of nonviolent protest called satyagraha, which he loosely translated as \"truth-force.\" Literally, it is formed from the Sanskrit words satya, \"truth\", and agraha, \"force.\"  In early 1930 the Indian National Congress chose satyagraha as their main tactic for winning Indian independence from British rule and appointed Gandhi to organise the campaign. Gandhi chose the 1882 British Salt Act as the first target of satyagraha. The Salt March to Dandi, and the beating by British police of hundreds of nonviolent protesters in Dharasana, which received worldwide news coverage, demonstrated the effective use of civil disobedience as a technique for fighting social and political injustice. The satyagraha teachings of Gandhi and the March to Dandi had a significant influence on American activists Martin Luther King, Jr., James Bevel, and others during the movement for civil rights for blacks and other minority groups in the 1960s."@en .

Immigration officials in New York sent him back to Nazi Germany because of technical problems with his papers.  Fortunately, Ries was permitted to enter America in January 1938, having crossed the Atlantic twice to do so.When America entered World War II, Ries immediately joined the army and fought in the Asian Theater, humorously pointing out that he served in Asia due to his \"good German\" skills.

Built in the United States by Rocketdyne, the RS-25 burns cryogenic liquid hydrogen & liquid oxygen propellants, with each engine producing 1,859 kN (418,000 lbf) of thrust at liftoff. Although the RS-25 can trace its heritage back to the 1960s, concerted development of the engine began in the 1970s, with the first flight, STS-1, occurring on April 12, 1981. The RS-25 has undergone several upgrades over its operational history to improve the engine's reliability, safety and maintenance load.The engine produces a specific impulse (Isp) of 452 seconds (4.43 km/s) in a vacuum, or 366 seconds (3.59 km/s) at sea level, has a mass of approximately 3.5 tonnes (7,700 pounds), and is capable of throttling between 67% and 109% of its rated power level in one-percent increments. The RS-25 operates under temperatures ranging from \u2212253 \u00B0C (\u2212423 \u00B0F) to 3,315 \u00B0C (6,000 \u00B0F).On the Space Shuttle, the RS-25 was used in clusters of three engines mounted in the aft structure of the Orbiter, with fuel being drawn from the external tank. The engines were used for propulsion during the entirety of the spacecraft's ascent, with additional thrust being provided by two solid rocket boosters and the orbiter's two AJ-10-190 Orbital Maneuvering System engines. Following each flight, the engines were removed from the orbiter, inspected and refurbished before being reused on another mission."@en .

He was appointed surgeon's mate on board the Edgar soon after his arrival at Edinburgh to pursue his medical studies. Later he served as assistant-surgeon in the Goliath under Sir John Jervis, and was present at St. Vincent and the siege of Cadiz. He also served with distinction at battles of the Nile and Trafalgar.Between 1805 and 1810 Burnett was in charge of the hospitals for prisoners of war at Portsmouth and Forton. His diligence in his most arduous hospital duties recommended Burnett in 1810 for the office of Physician and Inspector of Hospitals to the Mediterranean Fleet. His health deteriorated and he returned to England towards the end of 1813; but in March 1814 he was able to undertake the medical charge of the Russian fleet in the Medway, which was suffering severely from fever. He combined with this the charge of the prisoners of war at Chatham, among whom a virulent fever was raging. On the completion of this service Burnett settled at Chichester as a physician until 1822, when Lord Melville offered him a seat at the Victualling Board as colleague of Dr. Weir, then Chief Medical Officer of the Navy.Later he became Physician-General of the Royal Navy (later renamed Director-General of the Medical Department of the Navy) and introduced valuable reforms, including requiring regular classified returns of diseases from naval medical officers, urging the erection of, and largely planned, the Melville Hospital at Chatham for naval patients, and introducing more humane treatment of naval lunatics at Haslar. In 1841 the naval medical corps testified their high regard for the benefits he had conferred on the service by presenting him with his full-length portrait by Sir Martin Archer Shee and a service of plate. He was largely instrumental in securing a better position for assistant-surgeons in the navy.Burnett was an elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1833. He was knighted on 25 May 1831, appointed physician-in-ordinary to King William IV on 13 April 1835, and soon after created a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order. He was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath by Queen Victoria in 1850.Burnett retired in 1855 and was succeeded as Director-General by Sir John Liddell.

Blane was appointed Physician to the Fleet (1779\u20131783) and accompanied Rodney to the West Indies in 1779. Blane did much to improve the health of sailors by heeding their diet and enforcing due sanitary precautions. Largely due to his advocacy, the entire navy in 1795 made the use of lemon juice mandatory to prevent scurvy. For this reason, \"limey\" (lemons being replaced by limes, which could be obtained from Britain's Caribbean colonies) later became a common slang word for a British person. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in December 1784 and delivered their Croonian lecture in 1788.He became Physician to St Thomas' Hospital (1783\u20131795), Physician Extraordinary to the Prince of Wales (1785) and Physician in Ordinary to the King (George IV and William IV). By virtue of these court and hospital appointments, he built up a good practice for himself in London, and the government constantly consulted him on questions of public hygiene.

G-Collections translated and published the English version in 2002.Kana: Little Sister focuses on storytelling, and falls into the subgenre of dating sims which are full of tragic events and meant to be emotionally moving for the player. It also falls into the subgenre of games, manga, and anime revolving around incestuous relationships. One playthrough of the game takes about 5 to 10 hours.The story of Taka and his little sister Kana is told from Taka's perspective, starting when Kana is just about to start high school and then delving into the past to explore the relationship between the two siblings.The game is a visual novel, displaying scenery and characters in the background while the characters' dialogue and Taka's narration are displayed as text. Music and sound effects are also used. The unhurried narration is intended to allow the player to identify with Taka (and Kana) as the story unfolds.Over the course of the game, the player is presented with approximately 30 decision points which determine which path the storyline will follow and, ultimately, which ending the player will achieve.Kana: Little Sister is an eroge and contains sex scenes. It is only sold in a few online stores. Because of its limited availability, the game is relatively unknown among American and European gamers. However, the English translation can still be purchased through sites like Amazon.com or Jlist.comThe game was originally developed for Windows. A Mac OS version was subsequently published in 2001. In 2003, Panther Software announced plans to release an Xbox port, which was ultimately cancelled in May 2005 after multiple delays.The original versions published by D.O. are now out of print.

According to Gilliam, the film's rhythm, length, and style of cinematography made it a poor fit as a scene in the larger movie, so it was presented as a supplementary short ahead of the film.It was a common practice in British cinemas to show an unrelated short feature before the main movie, a holdover from the older practice of showing a full-length \"B\" movie ahead of the main feature. By the mid-1970s the short features were of poorer quality, or simply banal travelogues.  As a kind of protest, the Pythons had already produced one spoof travelogue narrated by John Cleese, Away from It All, which was shown before The Life of Brian in Britain.The film includes actor Matt Frewer's debut performance."@en .

It went on to become one of the highest grossing films of 2000, earning over $160 million in North America and over $330 million worldwide. Meet the Parents was well received by film critics and viewers alike, winning several awards and earning additional nominations. Ben Stiller won two comedy awards for his performance and the film was chosen as the Favorite Comedy Motion Picture at the 2001 People's Choice Awards.

He was a founding member of the Natural History Society of Boston and most of his career was spent at Amherst College. He did the majority of his collecting on the slopes of Mount Washington in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Tuckerman Ravine was named in his honor. The standard botanical author abbreviation Tuck. is applied to species he described.Tuckerman was the eldest son of a Boston merchant, also Edward Tuckerman, and Sophia (May) Tuckerman. He studied at Boston Latin School and then at his father's urging at Union College in Schenectady, which he entered as a sophomore and where he completed a BA in 1837 and to which he returned for his MA after taking a Law degree at Harvard in 1839, traveling in Germany and Scandinavia, and making the first of his botanical studies in the White Mountains. In 1846 he returned to Harvard as a senior (telling the President he intended to correct his father's error in breaking the family tradition), completed a second BA in 1847, then two or three years later entered the Divinity School and graduated from there in 1852.After teaching at Union College, Tuckerman was a professor at Amherst College from 1854 until his death, successively Lecturer in History, Professor of Oriental History, and from 1858 Professor of Botany. Amherst awarded him an LLD.His first paper, on New England lichens, was given in 1838 or 1839. In 1843 he published privately the first serious systematic analysis of the genus Carex, Enumeratio Methodica Caricum Quarundam. Tuckerman liked to write his botanical studies in Latin. He also made the first systematic study of native Potamogeton, and after becoming Professor of Botany at Amherst, began preparing A Catalogue of Plants Growing without cultivation within 30 miles of Amherst College (published in 1875).  However, his main focus was lichens. He published a number of important studies in the field, drawing on both his own collecting and specimens sent to him from elsewhere, in particular by Charles Wright from Cuba. His career culminated in the publication of Genera Lichenum: An Arrangement of the North American Lichens (1872) and Synopsis of the North American Lichens, Part 1 (1882). His last botanical publication was in 1884, and he may have published anonymous theological articles after that.  Tuckerman did not accept that lichens are a combination of fungi and algae, a theory advanced late in his life.Tuckerman was married to Sarah, daughter of Thomas Parkman Cushing, who was his father's business partner.

Born in 1901, he choreographed from the 1920s to the 1970s until his death in 1975. While he is most famous for his work with Doris Humphrey, Weidman did a lot of work on his own.

The film was released in the United States on July 2, 1986. Kurt Russell plays truck driver Jack Burton, who helps his friend Wang Chi (Dennis Dun) rescue Wang's green-eyed fiancee (Suzee Pai) from bandits in San Francisco's Chinatown. They go into the mysterious underworld beneath Chinatown, where they face an ancient sorcerer named David Lo Pan (James Hong).Although the film was originally envisioned as a Western set in the 1880s, screenwriter W. D. Richter was hired to rewrite the script extensively and modernize everything. The studio hired Carpenter to direct the film and rushed Big Trouble in Little China into production so that it would be released before a similarly themed Eddie Murphy film, The Golden Child, which was slated to come out around the same time. The project fulfilled Carpenter's long-standing desire to make a martial arts film.The movie was a commercial failure, grossing $11.1 million in North America, below its estimated $20 million budget. It received mixed reviews that left Carpenter disillusioned with Hollywood and influenced his decision to return to independent film-making.  It has since become a cult classic, with an 83% average rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a steady audience on home video."@en .

Their pairing helped yield several major trophies in the most successful era in Leeds' history.

He became disillusioned with aspects of the job, such as suffering at the hands of non-committal boardrooms, and left management permanently in 1985.

Having graduated from Yale in 1837, Pierrepont studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1840. During the American Civil War, Pierrepont was a Democrat, although he supported President Abraham Lincoln. Pierrepont supported President Andrew Johnson's conservative Reconstruction efforts having opposed the Radical Republicans. In both 1868 and 1872, Pierrepont supported Ulysses S. Grant for President. For his support, President Grant appointed Pierrepont New York Attorney in 1869. In 1871, Pierrepont gained the reputation as a solid reformer, having joined New York's Committee of Seventy that shut down Boss Tweed's corrupt Tammany Hall. In 1872, Pierrepont modified his views on Reconstruction and stated that African American freedman's rights needed to be protected.In April 1875, Pierrepont was appointed U.S. Attorney General by President Ulysses S. Grant, who having teamed up with Secretary of Treasury, Benjamin Bristow, vigorously prosecuted the notorious Whiskey Ring, a national tax evasion swindle that involved whiskey distillers, brokers, and government officials, including President Grant's private secretary, Orville E. Babcock. Upon his appointment, Pierrepont quickly cleaned up corruption in Southern U.S. Districts. Pierrepont had continued former Attorney General George H. Williams moratorium on prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan had been previously prosecuted by President Grant's Attorneys General Amos T. Akerman and Williams from 1871 to 1873, prosecuting civil rights violations of whites against African Americans. Pierrepont ruled that a naturalized Prussian immigrant's son born in the U.S. was not obligated to serve in the Prussian military as an adult. In his ruling of the Chorpenning Claim, Pierrepont cited the Supreme Court case Gorden v United States, having agreed that the Postmaster General, as well as the Secretary of War, served as ministers rather than legally binding arbitrators for a monetary claim by a private citizen. After serving as Attorney General, Pierrepont was appointed Minister to Great Britain by President Grant serving from 1876 to 1877. After many visits to France, Pierrepont became an advocate for bimetalism. Having returned from England, Pierrepont resumed his law practice until his death in 1892."@en .

Generally, it contains no physical particles. Zero-point field is sometimes used as a synonym for the vacuum state of an individual quantized field.According to present-day understanding of what is called the vacuum state or the quantum vacuum, it is \"by no means a simple empty space\", and again: \"it is a mistake to think of any physical vacuum as some absolutely empty void.\" According to quantum mechanics, the vacuum state is not truly empty but instead contains fleeting electromagnetic waves and particles that pop into and out of existence.The QED vacuum of quantum electrodynamics (or QED) was the first vacuum of quantum field theory to be developed. QED originated in the 1930s, and in the late 1940s and early 1950s it was reformulated by Feynman, Tomonaga and Schwinger, who jointly received the Nobel prize for this work in 1965. Today the electromagnetic interactions and the weak interactions are unified in the theory of the electroweak interaction.The Standard Model is a generalization of the QED work to include all the known elementary particles and their interactions (except gravity). Quantum chromodynamics is the portion of the Standard Model that deals with strong interactions, and QCD vacuum is the vacuum of quantum chromodynamics. It is the object of study in the Large Hadron Collider and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, and is related to the so-called vacuum structure of strong interactions."@en .

The film was based on a novel of the same title by Glenn Savan (who appears in the film as an extra with a small speaking part), and was directed by Luis Mandoki from a screenplay by Ted Tally and Alvin Sargent. The original music score is composed by George Fenton.  The film is marketed with the tagline \"The story of a younger man and a bolder woman.\" The title was originally to have been The White Castle, and the novel even makes reference to a specific real White Castle location at the intersection of S. Grand Blvd. and Gravois Ave. in south St. Louis, but the restaurant chain refused permission to use its trademarked name in either the novel or the film, and also refused permission to allow any of its restaurants for filming locations.Instead, an independent diner at the intersection of North Eighteenth and Olive Streets just west of downtown St. Louis was used \u2013 and that address is even given in the film as a plug for the diner.  After the film was released the diner's owners sought permission to permanently rename it \"White Palace\", but were refused by the studio, so the diner was instead renamed \"White Knight\".The movie also features Jason Alexander, Kathy Bates, Steven Hill, Jeremy Piven, and Renee Taylor, and was shot almost entirely in the St. Louis area, one of the few major movie productions to be filmed and set there, including the Thanksgiving Dinner scenes, which were filmed in a private home off Conway Road located at #2 Frontenac Place in west St. Louis County, and Nora's house, which was in the Dogtown neighborhood of the City of St. Louis northwest of the intersection of Hampton and Manchester Avenues at 1521 W.

Videophone service provided the first form of videotelephony, later to be followed by videoconferencing, webcams, and finally high-definition telepresence.At the dawn of its commercial deployment from the 1950s through the 1990s, videotelephony also included 'image phones' which would exchange still images between units every few seconds over conventional POTS-type telephone lines, essentially the same as slow scan TV systems. The development of advanced technology video codecs and high bandwidth Internet telecommunication services allowed videophones to provide high quality colour service between users almost anyplace in the world that the Internet is available, often at low or nominal costs.In the present day videophones have become widely available at reasonable cost, although not widely used in everyday communications for a variety of reasons. However, they are particularly useful to the deaf  and speech-impaired who can use them with sign language, and are becoming increasingly popular for educational instruction, telemedicine and to those with mobility issues."@en .

Following graduation from the Royal College of Science, London, in 1898, he became an assistant to Guglielmo Marconi, the Italian radio entrepreneur. In 1901 he received his doctorate from the Royal College of Science. Eccles was an advocate of Oliver Heaviside's theory that a conducting layer of the upper atmosphere could reflect radio waves around the curvature of the Earth, thus enabling their transmission over long distances. Originally known as the Kennelly\u2013Heaviside layer, this region of the Earth's atmosphere became known as the Ionosphere. In 1912 Eccles suggested that solar radiation was responsible for the observed differences in radio wave propagation during the day and night. He carried out experiments into atmospheric disturbances of radio waves and used wave detectors and amplifiers in his work. Eccles invented the term Diode to describe an evacuated glass tube containing two electrodes; an anode and a cathode.Following World War I Eccles' main interest was in electronic circuit development. In 1918 he worked in collaboration with F. W. Jordan to patent the flip-flop circuit, which became the basis of electronic memory in computers. In 1919, Eccles became vice-chairman of the Imperial Wireless Committee. He helped in the design of the first long wave radio station, and became involved in the early work of the British Broadcasting Company (later the BBC) following its establishment in 1922.William Eccles was a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). He was President of the Physical Society from 1928 to 1930, President of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE) in 1926, and President of the Radio Society of Great Britain (RSGB) in 1923-24.He died in Oxford."@en .

The castle has never been conquered, probably because of the location and the massive fortress. The oldest part is an oval with many walls and a tall slim tower in the front. Above the ditch and entrance to the castle there is a dwelling building on the other side of the structure. After 1469 the castle was completely rebuilt Bishop Tas from Boskovice. In the 20th century the castle was abandoned and it fell into ruins. In 1762 there was a big fire in the castle and it was completely destroyed. Many repairs were made, but the castle is still undergoing restoration. The best preserved structure is St. Andrew\u00B4s chapel, where many concerts take place, enhanced by the excellent acoustics.

He won the Golden Globe for Best Director and the film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture. In 1961 he directed The Hustler, which was nominated for nine Oscars and won two. Rossen was nominated as Best Director and with Sidney Carroll for Best Adapted Screenplay but did not win either award.After directing and writing for the stage in New York, Rossen moved to Hollywood in 1937. There he worked as a screenwriter for Warner Bros. until 1941, and then interrupted his career to serve until 1944 as the chairman of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization Against the War, a body to organize writers for the effort in World War II. In 1945 he joined a picket line against Warner Bros., making an enemy of Jack Warner. After making one film for Hal Wallis's newly formed production company, Rossen made one for Columbia Pictures, another for Wallis and most of his later films for his own companies, usually in collaboration with Columbia.Rossen was a member of the American Communist Party from 1937 to about 1947, and believed the Party was \"dedicated to social causes of the sort that we as poor Jews from New York were interested in.\" However, he finally ended all relations with the Party in 1949. Rossen was twice called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), in 1951 and in 1953. He exercised his Fifth Amendment rights at his first appearance, refusing to state whether he had ever been a Communist. As a result he found himself blacklisted by Hollywood studios as well as unable to renew his passport. At his second appearance he named 57 people as current or former Communists and his blacklisting ended. In order to repair finances he produced his next film, Mambo, in Italy in 1954. While The Hustler in 1961 was a great success, conflict with the star of Lilith so disillusioned Rossen that he made no more films during the last three years of his life.Rossen's films for Warner generally described the conditions of working people, the portrayal of gangsters and racketeers, and opposition to fascism. He wrote that ambition and the desire for success were common themes in his work. His films often featured strong female characters. All Rossen's playscripts were adaptions except three he based on real events. While head of production at Warner, Wallis considered that some of his best films were written by Rossen."@en .

The geyser shoots steam and water to heights of 75 feet (23 m) in an arch over the river, sometimes causing brilliant rainbows. The eruptions occur every 51\u20442 to 7 hours. As is Daisy, Riverside is one of the most predictable geysers in the park, because it is not located near any other geysers that may disrupt the flow of underground water in the geyser's plumbing. Riverside is unique in its way that eruptions seldom occur at the average interval for any given time. Instead, Riverside is bimodal, meaning it usually erupts 20 minutes before or 25 minutes late for a duration of 20 minutes. The bimodality does not represent a problem for predictions if the previous erupt time is seen. If not, you are predicting on doubles and triples, which leads to a wide range for uncertainty. For an hour or two before the eruption, water pours over the edge of the cone. The geyser was named by the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871.The geyser is one of the most reliable geysers in Yellowstone, despite the moniker and reputation of the better-known Old Faithful."@en .

He has been described by previous record goal-scorer Bobby Tambling and long-term teammate John Terry as Chelsea's greatest ever player.Lampard began his career at West Ham United, for whom his father Frank Lampard, Sr. had also played. He secured a place in the first team by the 1997\u201398 season, and the following year helped the team finish 5th in the Premier League, their highest-ever Premier League placing. In 2001, he moved to rival London club Chelsea for \u00A311 million. In 2014, he was released by Chelsea after 13 years of service. Lampard then joined New York City FC on a two-year deal, in preparation for the club's Major League Soccer debut in 2015, as a free transfer, being  loaned out to Manchester City in the meantime. On December 31st, 2014, BBC Sport's David Ornstein revealed Lampard is under contract with Manchester City Football Club instead of New York City Football Club as previously claimed by both clubs. From his d\u00E9but, he was ever-present in the Chelsea first team and made 164 consecutive Premier League appearances, a record for an outfield player.

He signed a new contract in 2008, becoming the highest-paid Premier League footballer at that time, and scored in his first Champions League Final that year. He won a second FA Cup winners' medal in 2009, scoring the winning goal in the final. In the 2009\u201310 season, Lampard helped Chelsea secure their first league and FA Cup Double, and also had his most prolific season with the club, scoring 22 league goals and 17 league assists.

The males of this species exhibit two types of mate locating behaviors: territorial defense and patrolling.

They result from the wind blowing over an area of fluid surface.  Waves in the oceans can travel thousands of miles before reaching land. Wind waves range in size from small ripples, to waves over 100 ft (30 m) high.When directly generated and affected by local winds, a wind wave system is called a wind sea. After the wind ceases to blow, wind waves are called swells. More generally, a swell consists of wind-generated waves that are not significantly affected by the local wind at that time. They have been generated elsewhere or some time ago. Wind waves in the ocean are called ocean surface waves.Wind waves have a certain amount of randomness: subsequent waves differ in height, duration, and shape with limited predictability. They can be described as a stochastic process, in combination with the physics governing their generation, growth, propagation and decay\u2014as well as governing the interdependence between flow quantities such as: the water surface movements, flow velocities and water pressure. The key statistics of wind waves (both seas and swells) in evolving sea states can be predicted with wind wave models.Although waves are usually considered in the water seas of Earth, the hydrocarbon seas of Titan may also have wind-driven waves."@en .

Joss did not sign with Mack's team, but he attracted further major league interest after winning 19 games in 1900 for the Toledo Mud Hens. Joss had another strong season for Toledo in 1901.After an offseason contract dispute between Joss, Toledo and Cleveland, he debuted with the Cleveland club in April 1902. Joss led the league in shutouts that year. By 1905, Joss had completed the first of his four consecutive 20-win seasons. Off the field, Joss worked as a newspaper sportswriter from 1906 until his death. In 1908, he pitched a perfect game during a tight pennant race that saw Cleveland finish a half-game out of first place; it was the closest that Joss came to a World Series berth. The 1910 season was his last, and Joss missed most of the year due to injury.In April 1911, Joss became ill and he died the same month due to tuberculous meningitis. He finished his career with 160 wins, 234 complete games, 45 shutouts and 920 strikeouts. Though Joss played only nine seasons and missed significant playing time due to various ailments, the National Baseball Hall of Fame's Board of Directors passed a special resolution for Joss in 1977 which waived the typical ten-year minimum playing career for Hall of Fame eligibility.

Taft then practiced as a lawyer in Ohio. He rose to a partnership in the law firm that would eventually become Arter and Hadden.Taft served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1933 to 1934 and then in 1940, he was elected to the Shaker Heights, Ohio, board of education on which he served until 1942, the last year as president. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, eventually rising to the rank of Major.In 1946, when U.S. Senator Harold H. Burton (R-Ohio) resigned in order to accept an appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court, the vacancy was filled by a special election. In that election Taft ran and defeated Democrat Henry P. Webber. Taft served out Burton's term, which expired in 1947. He also served with distant family member Robert Alphonso Taft during his 4 month tenure, and did not run for election to the next full term.In 1948, he was elected to a judgeship on the Ohio Supreme Court, defeating Democrat Robert M. Sohngen. In 1954, he was re-elected to the position without opposition. In 1960, Taft defeated Joseph H. Ellison for a third term on the Supreme Court, but in 1962, Taft decided to run for Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court. Taft then beat Democratic incumbent Carl V. Weygandt. Weygant, who was 74 years old and seeking a 6th term, lost by a margin of less than 1,600 votes, out of more than 2.6 million votes cast. In 1968, Taft was re-elected Chief Justice of the Court, defeating Democrat John C. Duffy, but died in office two years after his last election in 1970.Taft was buried at Lakeview Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio.Taft met his wife Louise Dakin at college. They were married September 14, 1927. They had four sons."@en .

Trained in medicine, he served as a military surgeon during the American Revolutionary War, notably at the Battle of Bunker Hill.  He resumed medical practice after the war, but soon entered politics.After several terms in the state legislature, Eustis won election to the United States Congress in 1800, serving as a moderate Democratic-Republican.  He briefly returned to state politics after losing reelection in 1804, and was chosen to be Secretary of War in 1809 by President James Madison.  Due in part to his inexperience at managing the army and a lack of preparedness, the military failures in the early months of the War of 1812 were laid on his shoulders, leading to his resignation.Madison then appointed Eustis Minister to the Netherlands, a post he held from 1814 until 1818.  After another period in Congress, he was elected Governor of Massachusetts in 1822.  A popular successor to long-serving John Brooks, Eustis died in office in 1825.

He and his sister Helen Rebecca Roosevelt (1881\u20131962) were the children of diplomat James Roosevelt \"Rosey\" Roosevelt (1854\u20131927) of the Roosevelt family and Helen Schermerhorn Astor (1855\u20131893) of the Astor family.Tadd's uncles were President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882\u20131945) and Colonel John Jacob \"Jack\" Astor IV (1864\u20131912), but nonetheless was three years older than Franklin. Tadd's paternal grandparents were businessman James Roosevelt I (1828\u20131900) and Rebecca Brien Howland (1831\u20131876) while his maternal grandparents were businessman William Backhouse Astor, Jr. (1829\u20131892) and socialite Caroline Webster \"Lina\" Schermerhorn (1830\u20131908).Upon his mother's death in November 1893, Tadd inherited $1,500,000 (equivalent to approximately $39,372,222 in 2015 dollars). He and Franklin both attended Groton School and Harvard University, with Tadd being ahead of Franklin. Their kinship led to Franklin often being mockingly referred to as \"Uncle Frank\" while the two attended Groton together.After Tadd dropped out from Harvard, he married Hungarian-born prostitute Sadie Messinger (c. 1880\u20131940) on June 14, 1900. Tadd's father Rosey, upon learning of the wedding, came down from Hyde Park and brought Tadd home. Their union sparked controversy, and Rosey ended up disowning Tadd. Grandmother Lina and Grandfather James also highly disapproved of his marriage to Sadie.In February 1917, Tadd was arrested in Florida and required to stay in Florida pending a divorce suit. He had lived in Daytona under the name \"M. S. King\" with a different woman than Sadie. The Roosevelt family had reportedly opposed the marriage to Sadie and had prevailed in achieving a separation, in which Sadie was to receive a $10,000 (equivalent to approximately $184,078 in 2015 dollars) annual income. A court soon granted $625 (equivalent to approximately $11,505 in 2015 dollars) per month alimony to Sadie, pending settlement of the divorce. At the time, Tadd was reported to be the Floridian paying the highest income taxes, having a $12,000,000 wealth (equivalent to approximately $220,893,506 in 2015 dollars).By October 1921, Tadd and Sadie were reportedly no longer living together. However, they remained married until her death. He died childless and left his money to the Salvation Army."@en .

Terrell had been ill, suffering from complications caused by a brain tumor, since the fall of 1967.

Simpson again explicitly denied having done so in the liner notes to The Complete Motown Singles series.

Those are Tammi Terrell vocals because we know that we went back in with Tammi and got what we needed.\"  Gaye at the time criticized Motown for the album thinking they were taking advantage of Terrell's health. Motown assured him proceeds from the album would go to Terrell's family for insurance of her health.

Contrary to popular belief, however, the speech was not given at the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco, California as a nomination speech for Barry Goldwater.  Richard Nixon gave that nomination speech.  Reagan, though he campaigned for Goldwater, did not use \"A Time for Choosing\" until October 27, 1964, when it was part of a pre-recorded television program, Rendezvous with Destiny.  In his autobiography Reagan recalled going to bed that night \"hoping I hadn't let Barry down.\"Speaking for Goldwater, Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government. In this speech, he revealed his ideological motivation: \"The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing.\" He also said, \"You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is only an up or down. Up to man's age-old dream \u2013 the maximum of individual freedom consistent with order \u2013 or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism.\" The speech raised $1 million for Goldwater's campaign and is considered the event that launched Reagan's political career.Soon afterwards, Reagan was asked to run for Governor of California. To this day, this speech is considered one of the most effective ever made on behalf of a candidate. Nevertheless, Barry Goldwater lost the election by one of the largest margins in history. Reagan was later called the \"Great Communicator\" in recognition of his effective speech-making skills."@en .

This allows travelling between stars, refuelling the Stardrifter from Lithium ion-ejecting stars, approaching planets in star systems and their moons, and even landing where it is physically possible. Many planets feature atmospheres and weather effects. Some harbour plants and animals, or even mysterious ruins. No goal or measure of success is imposed by the game: it simply allows to catalogue and annotate the player's discoveries in a common database of stellar bodies called the GUIDE, which is to be synchronised over the author's Internet server. The player can explore the Stardrifter and even walk on its roof.In the game's sci-fi setting, a fleet of Stardrifters was left behind by a race of sentient cats known as Felysians who abandoned their home world (planet Felysia, star system Balastrackonastreya) long ago for unknown reasons.

For the three-shot rifle salute given at military and law enforcement funerals, see Three-volley salute.Gun salutes are the firing of cannons or firearms as a military honor.The custom stems from naval tradition, where a warship would fire its cannons harmlessly out to sea, until all ammunition was spent, to show that it was disarmed, signifying the lack of hostile intent. As naval customs evolved, 21 guns came to be fired for heads of state, with the number decreasing with the rank of the recipient of the honor.While the 21-gun salute is the most commonly recognized, the number of rounds fired in any given salute will vary depending on the conditions. Circumstances affecting these variations include the particular occasion and, in the case of military and state funerals, the branch of service, and rank (or office) of the person to whom honors are being rendered."@en .

The grey teal has almost identical colouration to the female chestnut teal and the Grey can only be distinguished by its lighter coloured neck and paler face. Juveniles are paler than adults, especially on the head.The grey teal nests near its favoured freshwater lakes and marshes, usually on the ground, but also in tree holes or rabbit burrows.This is a vocal duck, especially at night. The male gives a soft preep, and the female has a loud quack.The grey teal is a gregarious species. In Australia it is nomadic, rapidly colonising suitable habitat following rain. In 1957, large numbers fled Australia, moving to New Zealand to escape drought.It was formerly considered a subspecies of the Sunda teal, as Anas gibberifrons gracilis.Widespread throughout its large range, the grey teal is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.It is often mistaken for a female chestnut teal, due to similar colouring."@en .

Concurrently, it is the world's third longest-running scripted drama series in production after British serials The Archers and Coronation Street, as well as the world's second-longest-running televised soap opera still in production. General Hospital premiered on the ABC television network on April 1, 1963. Same-day broadcasts as well as classic episodes were aired on SOAPnet from January 20, 2000 until Disney discontinued SOAPnet on December 31, 2013. GH is the longest-running serial produced in Hollywood, and the longest-running entertainment program in ABC television history. It holds the record for most Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Drama Series, with 11 wins.The show was created by husband-and-wife soap writers Frank and Doris Hursley, who originally set it in a general hospital (hence the title) in an unnamed fictional city. In the 1970s, the city was named Port Charles, New York. From its beginning, General Hospital starred John Beradino and Emily McLaughlin, and both actors stayed with the show until their deaths in 1996 and 1991 respectively. They were joined a year later by Rachel Ames who remains to date the longest serving actress on an ABC soap opera, having been continuously on the show from 1964 to 2007. General Hospital was the second soap to air on ABC (after the short-lived Road to Reality, which aired for several months during the 1960\u201361 season). In 1964, a sister soap was created for General Hospital, The Young Marrieds; it ran for two years, and was canceled because of low ratings. General Hospital also spawned a primetime spinoff with the same name in the United Kingdom from 1972 to 1979, as well as the daytime series Port Charles (1997\u20132003) and the primetime spin-off General Hospital: Night Shift (2007\u20132008) in the United States. Taped at The Prospect Studios, General Hospital aired for a half-hour until July 23, 1976. The series was expanded from 30 minutes to 45 minutes on July 26, 1976, and then to a full hour on January 16, 1978.Ever since the late 1970s, most of the storylines have revolved around the Quartermaines and the Spencers. From 1979 to 1988, General Hospital had more viewers than any other daytime soap opera. It rose to the top of the ratings in the early 1980s in part thanks to the monumentally popular \"supercouple\" Luke and Laura, whose 1981 wedding brought in 30 million viewers and remains the highest-rated hour in American soap opera history. The soap opera is also known for its high-profile celebrity guest stars who have included, among others, Roseanne Barr, James Franco and the late Elizabeth Taylor. In 2007, the program was listed as one of Time magazine's \"100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME.\" On April 23, 2009, General Hospital began broadcasting in high definition, making it the first ABC soap opera to make such a transition. The series aired its 13,000th episode on February 24, 2014.General Hospital became the oldest American soap opera on September 17, 2010, when As the World Turns ended. On April 14, 2011, ABC announced the cancelation of both All My Children and One Life to Live, leaving General Hospital as the only soap opera airing on the network after January 13, 2012.  The show celebrated its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2013."@en .

The term has become largely synonymous with interactive 3D virtual environments, where the users take the form of avatars visible to others. These avatars can be textual, two or three-dimensional graphical representations, or live video avatars with auditory and touch sensations.  In general, virtual worlds allow for multiple users.The user accesses a computer-simulated world which presents perceptual stimuli to the user, who in turn can manipulate elements of the modeled world and thus experience a degree of telepresence. Such modeled worlds and their rules may draw from the reality or fantasy worlds. Example rules are gravity, topography, locomotion, real-time actions, and communication. Communication between users can range from text, graphical icons, visual gesture, sound, and rarely, forms using touch, voice command, and balance senses.Massively multiplayer online games depict a wide range of worlds, including those based on science fiction, the real world, super heroes, sports, horror, and historical milieus. The most common form of such games are fantasy worlds, whereas those based on the real world are relatively rare.   Most MMORPGs have real-time actions and communication. Players create a character who travels between buildings, towns, and worlds to carry out business or leisure activities.  Communication is usually textual, but real-time voice communication is also possible. The form of communication used can substantially affect the experience of players in the game.Virtual worlds are not limited to games but, depending on the degree of immediacy presented, can encompass computer conferencing and text based chatrooms. Sometimes, emoticons or 'smilies' are available to show feeling or facial expression. Emoticons often have a keyboard shortcut. Edward Castronova is an economist who has argued that \"synthetic worlds\" is a better term for these cyberspaces, but this term has not been widely adopted."@en .

South then continued and observed another 458 double stars over the following year.He won the Copley Medal in 1826 and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in that same year.  He was knighted in 1831. Craters on Mars and the Moon are named in his honor. Starting around 1826, James South made plans for a new, larger telescope, an equatorially mounted achromatic refractor (a telescope with a lens) in a new observatory. He bought a 12-inch (actually about 11.8) aperture lens from Robert-Agla\u00E9 Cauchoix in Paris for about 1000 pounds, large enough to be the biggest achromatic object lens in the world at the time. The telescope for the lens was completed, but dismantled around 1838. The next largest refractor, was at the Markree Observatory, which successfully completed a 13.3 inch refractor (also a Cauchoix of Paris lens) in the 1830s on a Thomas Grubb mount.  The problem for James South's telescope was the equatorial mount.South was involved in a notorious lawsuit brought against him by the instrument maker Edward Troughton over this equatorial-mount telescope which the latter had constructed for him, and which South considered defective.  Troughton sued him for payment and won.  South promptly demolished the telescope mount; the 12 inch lens, which had been purchased separately, was preserved and presented to the (Dublin) Dunsink Observatory in 1862.

Reflecting \"the tumultuous politics of the early 70s\" in India, Deewaar tells the story of a pair of impoverished brothers who, after their family is betrayed by the misplaced idealism of their father, struggle to survive on the streets of Mumbai.Deewaar was a ground-breaking work. It was one of a slew of films establishing Bachchan as the \"angry young man\" of Bollywood cinema and Parveen Babi as the \"new Bollywood woman\" whose character Anita is \"a liberated working girl, smoking, drinking and sleeping with her lover, defying every Hindi film heroine rule.\" The movie cemented the success of the writing duo Salim-Javed, who went on to write many more blockbuster films. It is said that after the success of this film, the value of film writers skyrocketed thanks to Salim-Javed, and they soon were being paid as highly as some actors at the time.The Deewaar in question refers to the wall that has sprung up between the two brothers, drawn apart by fate and circumstance in a time of socio-political turmoil.Deewaar received the Filmfare Best Movie Award of 1975 in addition to six other Filmfare Awards and was a \"superhit\" at the box office, ranking as the 4th highest grossing Bollywood film of 1975. Indiatimes ranks Deewaar amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films."@en .

Until then he had never even seen a game of football and a teacher at this school, on watching his early efforts and reflecting on his birthplace opined \"Well, perhaps cricket is your game\". However, he was signed as a schoolboy by Arsenal, and was the first black player to play for the Gunners' first team. In all, he made 10 appearances for Arsenal before moving to Cambridge United in 1974. He spent four years at Cambridge, captaining the side to the Fourth Division Championship under manager Ron Atkinson in 1976-77. When Atkinson moved to West Bromwich Albion in 1978, he attracted Batson to follow him and to team up with fellow black players Cyrille Regis and Laurie Cunningham. Although not by any means the first black footballers to play professionally in England, the Three Degrees (a reference to The Three Degrees contemporary vocal trio of the same name) were an integral part of their acceptance in the English leagues.A cultured defender, Batson's career was cut short by a serious playing injury in 1982, following which he developed into an able and active administrator at the Professional Footballers' Association.

In December 1964, Wilson suffered through a nervous breakdown while on a plane, and was introduced to marijuana as a stress reliever. He then became a regular user after he realized the profound effect it had on the way he perceived music, subsequently resigning from touring with the group in order to focus solely on songwriting and producing.The tracks on the first half of Today! feature an electric guitar-rock oriented sound that contrasts the second half consisting of ballads, showing an increased mature lyrical depth that would foreshadow future efforts like Pet Sounds. The second side marks Wilson's continuing maturation as a recording artist; all the songs showcase creatively developed vocal & instrumental arrangements, complex Wall of Sound production, and lyrically introspective subject matter.In 2012, the album was voted 271 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".

He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he first linked up with the Cork minor team, before later lining out with the junior side. He made his senior debut in the 1939-40 National Hurling League. Ring went on to play a key part for Cork over the following twenty-four years, and won eight All-Ireland medals, nine Munster medals and three National Hurling League medals. An All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions, Ring also captained the team to three All-Ireland victories.Ring represented the Munster inter-provincial team for a record twenty-three consecutive seasons, winning a record eighteen Railway Cup medals. No other player in the history of the competition has gone into double figures. At club level he won thirteen championship medals with Glen Rovers.In a game as mythologised as hurling, Ring's universally accepted pre-eminence is remarkable. His career tally of 33 goals and 208 points was a record score which stood until the 1970s when it was surpassed by Eddie Keher. His haul of eight All-Ireland medals was a record which stood for over a decade until it was equalled by John Doyle and subsequently surpassed by Henry Shefflin. At the age of thirty-nine he was named Caltex Hurler of the Year.Throughout his lengthy career, Ring made 65 championship appearances for Cork, more than any other player in the county's history and a national record which stood for nearly fifty years until it was surpassed by Brendan Cummins. His retirement came prior to the start of the 1964 championship when he failed to be selected for the Cork hurling team.Ring is widely regarded as one of the greatest hurlers in the history of the game, with many former players, commentators and fans rating him as the number one player of all-time. He has been repeatedly voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including the Hurling Team of the Century in 1984 and the Hurling Team of the Millennium"@en .

The patented cambering mechanism allows the rider to propel this chain-less and pedal-less human-powered vehicle without ever touching foot to ground.  The design provides a stable 3-point platform that lets riders lean into the turns while all three wheels remain in contact with the ground.The front wheel can be turned left and right using the handlebars, with the axis of rotation offset towards the front of the wheel.  The rear wheels are connected to independent arms and are fixed to face directly forward.  The independent arms are almost touching at the front end, and are around 30 cm (12 in) apart at the rear end.  The rider stands on the two foot platforms above the rear wheels.  The mechanism that joins the independent arms and the front wheel/handlebars structure allows all three wheels to remain touching the ground when the handlebars are leaned to the left or right.  The handlebars have two brake levers that control the brakes on the left and right rear wheels independently (although they are always both applied by the rider at the same time).A Trikke is propelled using a motion that moves the vehicle along a curved S shaped path.  The rider moves the vehicle from side to side at a rough cadence of one turn per second.  Each turn requires the rider to turn the handlebars in the direction of the turn, lean the front structure towards the side they are turning, move their body weight toward the side they are turning, and push out slightly with the foot at the outside of the turn.  The weight of the rider during a turn (or \u201Ccarve\u201D) is placed mainly on the foot at the outside of the turn.  The inside foot will support very little weight and the rider will often lift the heel of this foot during the turn.  There are many variations on the Trikke riding technique as riders place different emphasis on the elements of the movement.The resulting motion is similar to slalom skiing.  The motion also has similarities to the tic-tac move on a skateboard.A Trikke can be propelled without need to push off with the foot.  Using the carving motion, a Trikke can achieve speeds of almost 30 km/h (19 mph), but more often cruise at around 15 km/h (9.3 mph).  A Trikke can be ridden uphill, albeit at a reduced speed."@en .

Work on the script had begun early with filmmaker Sydney Pollack on board, before De Palma, Steven Zaillian, David Koepp, and Robert Towne were brought in. Mission: Impossible went into pre-production without a shooting script. De Palma came up with some action sequences, but Koepp and Towne were dissatisfied with the story that led up to those events.U2 band members Larry Mullen, Jr. and Adam Clayton produced an electronic dance version of the original theme song. The song went into top ten of music charts around the world and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.

At age nine, he fell on the railway tracks and his hand was badly injured when the train ran over it. Without proper medical care, and fearful of deadly gangrene poisoning, his arm was amputated about two inches below the elbow.In 1884, the family emigrated to the United States, settling in Bayonne, New Jersey where as a young man he built a bicycle business and ran a pool hall. It was then that he met a former employee of Biograph Studios, Charles Gorman, and along with his brother William Horsley (1870\u20131956), they formed the Centaur Film Company. By 1910 their operation was producing three films a week, including the Mutt and Jeff comedies.David and William Horsely, along with other film independents, succeeded in defeating the monopolistic hold on the industry of Thomas Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company. However, weather conditions on the east coast made filming an uncertain proposition because camera technology at the time relied on sunshine. Frustrated, and realizing that California afforded the opportunity to make films year round, David Horsley moved his operations to the west coast.Among the first motion pictures ever filmed in Hollywood was taken on October 26, 1911 in the orchards of H J Whitley's estate (D.W. Griffith filmed \"Love Among the Roses\" at the studio of famed French floral painter, Paul de Longpre at his some and studio in Hollywood in 1909).  Although the movie never really had a name it is a true piece of Hollywood history.  In the fall of 1911, the Nestor Motion Picture Company opened the first motion picture studio in Hollywood in the Blondeau Tavern building at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street. With Horsley was Al Christie who served as general manager and in charge of Christie Comedies plus Charles Rosher who lent his expertise as the studio's full-time cameraman. Other east coast films companies recognized Horsley's advantage and quickly followed his lead.In April 1912, the Universal Film Company was formed and David Horsley and other small studios merged, each accepting shares in Universal as payment for their business. Horsley received $175,000 in preferred stock and $204,000 in common stock in the new Universal Film Company and was also appointed the company's treasurer. However, the peaceful merger soon turned sour and in 1913 Horsley sold his interest to Carl Laemmle. A wealthy man, David Horsley travelled to his birthplace and around Europe.After returning to California, and investing in a failed exotic animal show, David Horsley went back into the motion picture business with David Horsley Studios and using the animals from the failed show, established the Bostock Jungle Films Company. By the spring of 1917, he had outfitted his new operations in Los Angeles at Main and Washington streets however a series of setbacks cost Horsley his entire fortune and left him in debt.David Horsley died in Los Angeles. He is interred in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Hollywood.His son, David Stanley Horsley (1906\u20131976), trained as a cinematographer and became an expert in special effects photography, working in the film industry for nearly thirty years."@en .

On October 27, 1911, Nestor opened the first movie studio actually located in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles. It was at the Blondeau Tavern building on the northwest corner of Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street. The first motion picture stage in Hollywood was built behind the tavern.Other East Coast studios had moved production to Los Angeles, prior to Nestor's move west. The California weather allowed for year-round filming and the ambitious studio operated three principal divisions under its Canadian-born general manager, Al Christie.The Horsley brothers remained in New Jersey, where their laboratory and offices handled the Hollywood studio's film processing and distribution. Al Christie moved permanently from the East, where he had been working with the Horsleys creating the extremely popular silent era Mutt and Jeff comedy shorts, to Southern California.One division at the Hollywood location, under director Milton H. Fahrney, made a one-reel western picture every week while the second division, under director Tom Ricketts, turned out a one-reel drama every week. In addition to running the operation, Christie oversaw a weekly production of a one-reel Mutt and Jeff episode.Other filmmakers began opening studios in the Hollywood area. The Horsleys operated the Nestor Studios at the Sunset and Gower location until May 20, 1912, when the Universal Film Company was formed, headed by Carl Laemmle. Nestor, along with several other motion picture companies, including Laemmle's Independent Moving Pictures (IMP), was merged with Universal.Various motion picture interests owned and operated studios on the site from 1912 until 1935, when the property was purchased by the Columbia Broadcasting System, which immediately demolished the Nestor stages and buildings and began construction of its new West Coast radio and pioneering television headquarters on the corner. The new building, completed at a cost of $2,000,000, was opened with major fanfare on April 30, 1938, with motion picture people from the silent and sound eras on hand for the dedication ceremonies."@en .

His father was a prosperous manufacturer and co-owner of Bernon Mill Village. Dorr's family occupied a good social position. Thomas Dorr never married, but two of his sisters wed prominent men and the son of one of them married a daughter of John Lothrop Motley. Dorr was no plebeian when he led the cause of the unenfranchised classes. As a boy, he attended Phillips Exeter Academy. He graduated from Harvard College in 1823, and then went to New York City, where he studied law under Chancellor James Kent and Vice-Chancellor William McCoun. He was admitted to the bar in 1827 and returned to Providence to practice. He began his political career as a representative in the Rhode Island General Assembly in 1834.In the half-century following the American Revolution efforts were made to expand the number of residents eligible to vote. In Rhode Island such attempts were made at intervals from 1797 to 1834, but had invariably been obstructed by the government. In 1834 a convention met at Providence to consider the matter again, and Dorr was a member of the committee which drew up an address to the people. All efforts at reform, however, were once more blocked by the legislature. By 1841 Rhode Island was almost the only state which had not adopted universal suffrage for white males. It was also the only state which had not adopted a written constitution, and the old colonial charter, under which the state was ruled, was outdated. Under that document the original grantees had had the sole right to decide who should have a voice in the management of public affairs, and they had decreed the possession of a moderate landed estate as a qualification for the franchise. By 1840 this ancient requirement meant that over half the adult male population did not have the right to vote, and about nineteen towns, having a total population of only 3,500 voters, returned over half the legislature, so that less than 1,800 voters could decide the future of a state where 108,000 persons lived. Moreover, no person who did not own real estate could bring suit for recovery of debt or obtain redress for personal injury unless a freeholder endorsed his writ.  Many had become landless with the onset of the Industrial Revolution, and their numbers were increasing with immigration from Ireland.In 1840 the Rhode Island Suffrage Association was formed to address this increasingly unsatisfactory situation, and processions and popular meetings were held.  Dorr took a leading part in the agitation. The legislature refused to remedy such grievances as were in its power, and the old charter did not provide any means of summoning a constitutional convention. A \"People's Party\", therefore, was formed, which held a convention, adopted a constitution, and submitted it to a vote of the people.  There were approximately 14,000 ballots cast in favor of it, and less than 100 cast against it.  Of those in favor, over 4,900 were qualified voters so that the proposed constitution was formally approved not only by the majority of the males over twenty-one but, it was alleged, even by a majority of the legal voters.  The constitutional question was a delicate one, but the existing government refused to consider any of these acts as legal. It had become sufficiently frightened, however, to call a constitutional convention itself and in turn submit a constitution to the people. The government's constitution was defeated by the narrow margin of 676 votes out of 16,702. The new constitution, though not giving Dorr and his followers all they had asked, did give them most of the substance, so their rejection of it may be seen as a tactical error. Had they not defeated it they might have had a practical victory.  Feelings, however, had become very bitter, and the Dorrites had already put their constitution into effect by electing an entire state ticket with Dorr as governor.  In May 1842 there were two governments which had both held elections and were both claiming the allegiance of the people. The People's Party did not attempt to seize the state house or machinery of government. Both governors issued proclamations, and Governor Samuel Ward King of the \"Law and Order\" party appealed to Washington for Federal aid. Dorr then went to Washington to plead his cause before President John Tyler. There he received no encouragement, and he returned to Rhode Island. Meanwhile King had proclaimed martial law, offered a US$5,000 reward for the capture of Dorr, and made wholesale imprisonments of the latter's followers under the \"Algerine Law\". Some minor clashes occurred between the Dorrites and the state troops, for example at Chepachet. Many of Dorr's followers deserted him and he fled the state on May 18, 1842, after a bungled attack on the Providence arsenal (which Dorr's father and younger brother, partisans of the \"Law and Order\" faction, were helping defend) led to the rebellion's disintegration. He returned briefly in June with a small band of New York volunteers, but hid in New Hampshire and Massachusetts when Governor King called out the state militia.Returning to Providence in October 1843, hoping the more liberal constitution now adopted would safeguard his liberty, Dorr was nonetheless arrested. King and the old government sought their revenge. Dorr was tried for treason against Rhode Island at Newport, a conservative stronghold, before the Rhode Island Supreme Court and sentenced to solitary confinement at hard labor for life. He was committed on June 27, 1844. Public opinion finally made itself felt and in 1845 an Act of General Amnesty was passed and Dorr was released after serving twelve months of his term. In 1851 he was restored his civil rights, and in January 1854 the legislature passed an act annulling the verdict of the supreme court, but this the court decided was unconstitutional. Dorr's health had been broken, and after his release he lived in retirement until his death. His work, however, bore fruit, for the old order had yielded at last, and in 1843 a third constitution had been drawn up and accepted by the people providing universal white male suffrage with merely symbolic qualifications. Today, Rhode Island's state government recognizes the legitimacy of Dorr's efforts and includes Dorr in its list of governors."@en .

Hind on December 15, 1852, at the private observatory of W. Bishop, located in Hyde Park, London, England. Bishop named it after Thalia, the Muse of comedy and pastoral poetry in Greek mythology.It is categorized as an S-type asteroid consisting of mainly of iron- and magnesium-silicates. This the second most common type of asteroid in the main belt. Based on analysis of the light curve, the object has a sidereal rotation period of 0.513202 \u00B1 0.000002 days. An ellipsoidal model of the light curve gives an /b ratio of 1.28 \u00B1 0.05.With a semimajor axis of 2.628, the asteroid is orbiting between the 3:1 and 5:2 Kirkwood gaps in the main belt. Its orbital eccentricity is larger than the median value of 0.07 for the main belt, and the inclination is larger than the median of below 4\u00B0. But most of the main-belt asteroids have an eccentricity of no more than 0.4 and an inclination of up to 30\u00B0, so the orbit of 23 Thalia is not unusual for a main-belt asteroid.Thalia has been studied by radar."@en .

It was the first asteroid found from North America. It is named after Euphrosyne, one of the Charites in Greek mythology.It is a fairly dark body near the belt's outer edge. Consequently Euphrosyne is never visible with binoculars, having a maximum magnitude at the best possible opposition of around +10.2, as in November 2011, which is actually fainter than any of the thirty asteroids previously discovered.It is a very little-studied body despite being one of the largest asteroids. It is a C-type asteroid with a primitive surface. Its orbit, however, is quite unusual and bears a considerable resemblance to that of 2 Pallas in its high inclination and eccentricity. Whereas Pallas and Eris\u2014the only larger bodies with comparably tilted orbits\u2014have nodes near perihelion and aphelion, Euphrosyne's perihelion lies at the northernmost point of its orbit. During a rare perihelic opposition Euphrosyne is very high in the sky from northern latitudes, but invisible from such countries as New Zealand and Chile.The mass estimate of Euphrosyne in Baer (2011) makes it apparently the 5th-most-massive asteroid, coming after only the big four. It also has the highest estimated density, indicating that it is a solid body like the other largest asteroids. However, all large asteroids with comparable densities (16 Psyche and 532 Herculina) have very large uncertainties, so both the mass and density are likely to be lower than the median estimate.Its rotation period is typical for large asteroids. Nothing is known of its axial tilt.Euphrosyne has been studied by radar.This object is the namesake of a family of 323\u20132066 asteroids that share similar spectral properties and orbital elements; hence they may have arisen from the same collisional event.

Guggenheim_Fellows 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allen_Forte> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "Allen Forte (December 23, 1926 \u2013 October 16, 2014) was an American music theorist and musicologist.He was born in Portland, Oregon. At the age of ten he appeared \"on a [local] radio show as a solo pianist among a bevy of similarly youthful performers,\" where he played the music of Cole Porter and others. He was in the US Navy and served in the Pacific Theatre toward the end of World War II. Afterward, he relocated to the East Coast and availed himself of the GI Bill to study music at Columbia. There he studied composition with Otto Luening and Vladimir Ussachevsky, although his main interests were forming around music theory and analysis.In the late 1950s, Forte taught music at various New York institutions: Columbia University Teachers College, Manhattan School of Music, and Mannes College of Music. In fall 1959 he began his long-term appointment at Yale, where he eventually became the Battell Professor of Music (retiring in 2003). He was influential there as both scholar and teacher, and in the latter capacity served as advisor to seventy-two Ph.D. dissertations completed between 1968 and 2002. (Yale did not offer a Ph.D. in theory for the first several years Forte was there.) A list of all his advisees and their dissertation titles appears in David Carson Berry, \"The Twin Legacies of a Scholar-Teacher: The Publications and Dissertation Advisees of Allen Forte,\" Gamut 2/1 (2009), 197-222. The list is ordered chronologically by submission, and each advisee is given an \"FA\" number to denote his or her ordering among the advisees. (\"FA\" stands for \u201CForte Advisee,\u201D and is also a retrograde of Allen Forte's initials.)Forte is well known for his book The Structure of Atonal Music (1973), which traces many of its roots to an article of a decade earlier: \"A Theory of Set-Complexes for Music\" (1964). In these works, he \"applied set-theoretic principles to the analysis of unordered collections of pitch classes, called pitch-class sets (pc sets). [...] The basic goal of Forte's theory was to define the various relationships that existed among the relevant sets of a work, so that contextual coherence could be demonstrated.\" Although the methodology derived from Forte\u2019s work \"has had its detractors ... textbooks on post-tonal analysis now routinely teach it (to varying degrees).\"Forte published analyses of the works of Webern and Berg and wrote about Schenkerian analysis and music of the Great American Songbook. A complete, annotated bibliography of his publications appears in the previously cited article, Berry, \"The Twin Legacies of a Scholar-Teacher.\" Excluding items only edited by Forte, it lists ten books, sixty-three articles, and thirty-six other types publications, from 1955 through early 2009Forte was also the editor of the Journal of Music Theory during an important period in its development, from volume 4/2 (1960) through 11/1 (1967). His involvement with the journal, including many biographical details, is addressed in David Carson Berry, \"Journal of Music Theory under Allen Forte's Editorship,\" Journal of Music Theory 50/1 (2006): 7-23.He has been honored by two Festschriften (homage volumes). The first, in commemoration of his seventieth birthday, was published in 1997 and edited by his former students James M. Baker, David W. Beach, and Jonathan W. Bernard (FA12, FA6, and FA11, according to Berry's list). It was titled Music Theory in Concept and Practice (a title derived from Forte's 1962 undergraduate textbook, Tonal Harmony in Concept and Practice). The second was serialized in five installments of Gamut: The Journal of the Music Theory Society of the Mid-Atlantic, between 2009 and 2013. It was edited by Forte's former student David Carson Berry (FA72) and was titled A Music-Theoretical Matrix: Essays in Honor of Allen Forte (a title derived from Forte's 1961 monograph, A Compositional Matrix). It included twenty-two articles by Forte's former doctoral advisees, and three special features: a previously unpublished article by Forte, on Gershwin songs; a collection of tributes and reminiscences from forty-two of his former advisees; and an annotated register of his publications and advisees.Forte was married to the French-born pianist Madeleine (Hsu) Forte, emerita professor of piano at Boise State University."@en .

Frost graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1926 and served in various ships and shore stations throughout the 1920s and 1930s. He was the commanding officer of Greer (DD-145) when that destroyer was attacked by a German U-boat on 4 September 1941. This was the first attack by Germany on a U.S. warship during World War II and occurred while the U.S. was officially neutral, some three months before America entered the war. After decorated service in World War II, Frost was assigned to Naval Intelligence and later saw combat as commander of the cruiser Manchester (CL-83) in the Korean War. He was Chief of Staff to Commander First Fleet in 1952.  He commanded Destroyer Flotilla Four, Atlantic Fleet in 1955-1956 and was Director of Naval Intelligence from 1956 until 1960. As head of Naval Intelligence he tried to change the U.S. policy on the rebellion in Indonesia.Frost became director of the National Security Agency in November 1960 with the rank of Vice Admiral. He held this post until 1962. Holding these posts during the beginning of the space race, Frost was involved in early decisions to promote surveillance satellites such as the Navy's ELINT program. In an effort to reduce tensions, soon after his arrival at NSA, Frost appointed Robert F. Rinehart as chairman of the National Security Agency Scientific Advisory Board specifically because he was the newest member of the board with only a few months' experience and so had fewer \"pre-acquired biases\" in Rinehart's words. According to the NSA, \"In 1962, when Vice Admiral Laurence Frost was unexpectedly transferred from his position...\" Gordon Blake was his replacement.After a final tour of duty at the Potomac River Naval Command, Admiral Frost retired in 1964.

This dark-surfaced body is probably composed of primitive carbonaceous chondrites. It was discovered by H.

Incorrect orbital calculations initially resulted in 56 Melete being mistaken for a second sighting of Daphne.  Daphne was not sighted again until August 31, 1862.The orbit of 41 Daphne places it in a 9:22 mean motion resonance with the planet Mars.

It was discovered by Robert Luther on September 15, 1857 from D\u00FCsseldorf. The name was chosen by the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Bonn and refers to Aglaea, one of the Charites in Greek mythology.Based upon its spectrum, 47 Aglaja is listed as a C-type asteroid under the Tholen classification taxonomy, indicating a carbonaceous composition. The SMASS classification system rates it as a rare B-type asteroid. There is a broad absorption feature at 1 \u03BCm that is associated with the presence of magnetite and is what gives the asteroid its blue tint.On September 16, 1984, the star SAO 146599 was occulted by 47 Aglaja. This event was observed from 13 sites in the continental United States, allowing a cross-sectional profile to be determined. Based upon this study, the asteroid has a diameter of 136.4 \u00B1 1.2 km. The geometric albedo at the time of the occultation was 0.071 \u00B1 0.002.Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico during 2012 gave a light curve with a period of 13.175 \u00B1 0.002 hours and a brightness variation of 0.09 \u00B1 0.01 in magnitude.

He studied at Trinity College Dublin.  When his father, Thomas, was executed for treason in 1641, William left the Kingdom of England for several years, mainly for fear of reprisals, and lived for a time in France. In 1652 he was allowed to return on taking an oath of abjuration. In 1662, the bill of attainder against his father was reversed by Parliament, and he regained the title of Earl of Strafford and was invested a Knight of the Garter in 1661.He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1668 but was expelled in 1685.According to his father's biographer, he led a rather \"obscure, undistinguished and uninteresting life\". She does however praise his speech in the House of Lords in 1667 protesting against the banishment of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, on the ground that no crime had been proved against him; his attitude is the more creditable since Clarendon had been one of his father's bitterest enemies. He became a member of the Privy Council in 1674, and attended the crucial meeting in 1678 when Titus Oates first revealed his fabricated Popish Plot. During the Exclusion Crisis, he supported James, and made a point of calling on him  when James travelled through Yorkshire on his way to Scotland in 1679.Wedgwood sums him up as \"rather indolent and lacking in character\"; but he was much loved by his family, especially his father, whose last letter was to \"dearest Will\" from \" a father that tenderly loves you\".On 27 February 1654, Strafford married Lady Henrietta Mary Stanley, the daughter of James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby and Charlotte de la Tremo\u00FCille, Countess of Derby. The marriage was childless and Henrietta predeceased him on 27 December 1685 (see [1] for details of the riots associated wither her funeral).

Main_Belt_asteroids 	<http://dbpedia.org/resource/55_Pandora> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract> "55 Pandora is a fairly large and very bright asteroid in the asteroid belt. Pandora was discovered by American astronomer and catholic priest George Mary Searle on September 10, 1858 from the Dudley Observatory near Albany, NY. It was his first and only asteroid discovery.It is named after Pandora, the first woman in Greek mythology, who unwisely opened a box that released evil into the world. The name was apparently chosen by Blandina Dudley, widow of the founder of the Dudley Observatory, who had been involved in an acrimonious dispute with astronomer B. A. Gould. Gould felt that the name had an \"apt significance\". The asteroid shares its name with Pandora, a moon of Saturn.Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Rozhen Observatory in Bulgaria during 2010 gave a light curve with a period of 4.7992 hours and a brightness variation of \u0394m=0.22 mag. This is consistent with a period of 4.804 hours and an amplitude of 0.24 obtained during a 1977 study.Recent analysis has identified Pandora as the second-largest of the E-type asteroids, after 44 Nysa."@en .

It orbit was computed by E. Schubert, who named it after Melete, the Muse of meditation in Greek mythology. It was originally confused for 41 Daphne before it was confirmed not to be by its second sighting on August 27, 1871. In 1861, the brightness of 56 Melete was shown to vary by German astronomer Friedrich Tietjen.To date, two stellar occultations by Melete have been observed successfully (in 1997 and again in 2002).Melete has been studied by radar. Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado Springs, Colorado in 2007 gave a light curve with a period of 18.151 \u00B1 0.002 hours and a brightness variation of 0.15 \u00B1 0.02 in magnitude.

Although he did not have an advanced academic degree, in the 1930s, he was editor of Pacific Affairs, a journal published by the Institute of Pacific Relations, and then taught at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, from 1938 to 1963. During World War II, he was an advisor to Chiang Kai-shek and the American government and contributed extensively to the public debate. From 1963 to 1970, Lattimore was the first Professor of Chinese Studies at the University of Leeds in England, where he taught Chinese History, richly flavoured with personal reminiscences. He died in 1989 in Providence, Rhode Island, having resided in his later years in Pawtucket.In the early post-war period of McCarthyism and the Red Scare, American wartime China Hands were accused of being agents of the Soviet Union or under the influence of Marxism. In 1950, Senator Joseph McCarthy accused Lattimore in particular of being \"the top Russian espionage agent in the United States.\"The accusations led to years of Congressional hearings that did not substantiate the charge that Lattimore had been a spy (and wartime intercepted Venona cables did not refer to him as one). The hearings did document Lattimore's sympathetic statements about Stalin and the Soviet Union, however. Although charges of perjury were dismissed, the controversy put an end to Lattimore's role as a consultant of the United States State Department and eventually to his career in American academic life.Lattimore's \"lifetime intellectual project,\" notes one recent scholar, was to \"develop a 'scientific' model of the way human societies form, evolve, grow, decline, mutate and interact with one another along 'frontiers.'\" He eclectically absorbed and often abandoned influential theories of his day that dealt with the great themes of history. These included the ecological determinism of Ellsworth Huntington; biological racism, though only to the extent of seeing characteristics which grew out of ecology; the economic geography and location theory; and some aspects of Marxist modes of production and stages of history, especially through the influence of Karl August Wittfogel. The most important and lasting influence, however, was Arnold J. Toynbee and his treatment of the great civilizations as organic wholes which were born, matured, grew old, and died. Lattimore's most influential book, The Inner Asian Frontiers of China (1940), used these theories to explain the history of East Asia not as the history of China and its influence on its neighbors, but as the interaction between two types of civilizations, settled farming and pastoral, each of which had its role in changing the other."@en .

It was Chacornac's sixth and final asteroid discovery.A controversy arose over the naming of Elpis. Urbain Le Verrier, director of the Paris Observatory, at first refused to allow Chacornac to name the object, because Leverrier was promoting a plan to reorganize asteroid nomenclature by naming them after their discoverers, rather than mythological figures. A protest arose among astronomers. At the Vienna Observatory, Edmund Weiss, who had been studying the asteroid, asked the observatory's director, Karl L. Littrow, to name it. Littrow chose Elpis, a Greek personification of hope, in reference to the favorable political conditions in Europe at the time. In 1862, Leverrier permitted Chacornac to choose a name, and he selected \"Olympia\" at the suggestion of John Russell Hind.  However, Elpis is the name that stuck.Elpis has been studied by radar."@en .

Both father and mother sailed from Boston, Massachusetts to Honolulu in 1819.  Only ten years old in 1840, Bingham was sent to the United States with his siblings Elizabeth Kaahumanu (1829\u20131899) and Lydia Bingham (1834\u20131915) to attend school.  Bingham was enrolled at Williston Seminary in Easthampton, Massachusetts and graduated from Yale University in 1853.Bingham was ordained a Congregationalist minister in New Haven, Connecticut on November 9, 1856.  Nine days later on November 18, Bingham married Clara Brewster in Northampton, Massachusetts.  The newlyweds arrived in Honolulu on April 24, 1857 where they both ministered to the native Hawaiians.  They eventually traveled and spread Christianity in several Pacific Ocean island communities.After a brief return to the United States in 1865, they arrived in Honolulu on March 13, 1867 for a stopover en route to the Marquesas Islands.  They went through Micronesia and returned to Honolulu again in 1868.  There they settled.  Bingham was the first to translate the Bible into Gilbertese, and wrote several hymn books, dictionaries and commentaries in the language of the Gilbert Islands.From 1877 to 1880, Bingham served as Secretary of the Hawaiian Board and in 1895, Yale University awarded him the Doctorate of Divinity.  He died October 25, 1908 in Baltimore, Maryland.Bingham's son, Hiram Bingham III, was an explorer who became a US Senator and (briefly) Governor of Connecticut.  His grandson, Hiram Bingham IV, was the US Vice Consul in Marseille, France during World War II who rescued Jews from the Holocaust.

He spent the majority of his 16-season playing career with the Chicago White Stockings and the Boston Beaneaters. Kelly was a player-manager three times in his career \u2013 in 1887 for the Beaneaters, in 1890 leading the Boston Reds to the pennant in the only season of the Players' League's existence, and in 1891 for the Cincinnati Kelly's Killers - before his retirement in 1893. He is also often credited with helping to popularize various strategies as a player such as the hit and run, the hook slide, and the catcher's practice of backing up first base.In only the second vote since its creation in 1939 the Old Timers Committee (now the Veterans' Committee) elected Kelly to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945.In concluding where to truly give Kelly credit as an innovator, a 2004 book devoted to 19th-century rule bending in baseball\u2014and which came close to exhaustively accounting for all contemporary reporting on various subjects\u2014placed stress on the following: \"Kelly's hook slide does sound special, and players probably tried to copy it.  Also, he seems to have been the first big leaguer to successfully cut a base (when the usually lone umpire wasn't looking), at least according to the newspaper record.\"  And, \"Kelly could have been the first to foul off lots of pitches on purpose.  Doing so was a top trick of some Baltimore players of the 1890s.  At the turn of the century, that trick was defused when all foul balls began counting as strikes.\"Kelly's autobiography Play Ball was published while he was with the Beaneaters in 1888, the first autobiography by a baseball player; it was ghostwritten by Boston baseball writer John J. \"Jack\" Drohan. Kelly also became a vaudeville performer during his playing career, first performing in Boston where he would recite the now-famous baseball poem \"Casey at the Bat,\" sometimes butchering it. Kelly's baserunning innovations are also the subject of the hit 1889 song entitled \"Slide, Kelly, Slide\" and a 1927 comedy film of the same name."@en .
